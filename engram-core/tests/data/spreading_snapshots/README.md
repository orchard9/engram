# Spreading Snapshot Fixtures

This directory will store deterministic activation traces generated by the spreading validation harness.

Each fixture captures:
- Graph topology description
- Activation parameters (seed, decay, hop limits)
- Ranked activation results and confidence measurements

Use the helper in `tests/spreading_validation_prep.rs` to refresh snapshots.
