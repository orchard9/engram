# Spreading Snapshot Fixtures

This directory will store deterministic activation traces generated by the spreading validation harness.

Each fixture captures:
- Graph topology description
- Activation parameters (seed, decay, hop limits)
- Ranked activation results and confidence measurements

Use `cargo xtask update-spreading-snapshots` to regenerate these baselines after
intentional engine changes. Review updates with `cargo insta review` before
committing to avoid accidentally accepting regressions.

## Deterministic Seeds & Cognitive Effect Sizes
- Snapshot regenerations use `deterministic_config(4242)` with per-fixture overrides recorded in `tests/support/graph_builders.rs`.
- Semantic priming harness (`cognitive_spreading_tests.rs`) seeds `doctor → nurse` scenarios with `deterministic_config(123)`, expecting the related term to outrank unrelated probes by at least 0.1 activation.
- Fan-effect checks reuse `deterministic_config(456)` and fixtures weighting spokes at `1/spokes`; low-fan spokes average roughly 3× the activation observed under the high-fan topology.
