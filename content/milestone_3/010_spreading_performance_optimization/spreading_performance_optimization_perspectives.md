# Spreading Performance Optimization Perspectives

## Multiple Architectural Perspectives on Task 010: Spreading Performance Optimization

### Systems Architecture Perspective

Spreading performance hinges on data locality. We reorganize activation nodes so hot fields populate the first cache line. Prefetch hints (`_mm_prefetch`) pull neighbor metadata before the SIMD kernel touches it. NUMA-awareness matters: we allocate pool slabs per NUMA node and pin spreading workers to the same node to avoid remote memory traffic.

### Rust Graph Engine Perspective

**Lock-Free Pool Implementation:**
We wrap a Treiber stack in epoch-based reclamation using `crossbeam_epoch` to avoid ABA problems.

```rust
pub fn release(&self, record: Box<ActivationRecord>) {
    record.reset();
    let guard = &epoch::pin();
    self.free_list.push(Box::into_raw(record), guard);
}
```

Per-thread caches (`ThreadLocal<Vec<NonNull<ActivationRecord>>>`) provide fast paths with no atomics. Metrics track hit rates so we can tune cache sizes.

### Memory Systems Perspective

Hot tier data (RAM) enjoys lower latency but also higher churn. We allocate larger pool slabs for hot tier to minimize fragmentation. Cold tier items, potentially memory-mapped from SSD, bypass the pool and rely on streaming access. Adaptive batching takes tier mix into accountâ€”more cold tier content means smaller batches to avoid cache thrash.

### Verification & Testing Perspective

Performance features need regression protection:
- Benchmark suite comparing baseline vs. optimized spread
- Perf counter assertions (cache miss rate < threshold)
- Long-duration soak tests to ensure pools do not leak
- Latency predictor accuracy tests using recorded traces

CI can run smaller perf tests with `cargo criterion --bench spreading_performance` to track trends.

### Technical Communication Perspective

Document configuration knobs: pool size, batch damping factor, latency budget. Provide tuning guides for different CPU families (Intel vs. AMD vs. ARM). Expose metrics via dashboards so operators can validate improvements.
