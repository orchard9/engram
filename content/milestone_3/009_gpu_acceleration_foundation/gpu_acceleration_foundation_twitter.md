## Thread: Building the GPU Runway Before the Jet Arrives

**Tweet 1/9**
No CUDA kernels yet? No problem. Task 009 defines the GPU interface now so future kernels drop in without rewriting the spreading engine.

**Tweet 2/9**
`GPUSpreadingInterface` exposes capabilities + async launch. CPU fallback implements the same trait, so recall code just asks for "a batch executor" and never cares where it runs.

**Tweet 3/9**
Batches use 32-byte aligned AoSoA buffers. One memcpy moves embeddings, activations, confidences. Designed for coalesced loads when CUDA joins.

**Tweet 4/9**
Dispatch heuristics: if batch â‰¥ 64 and GPU healthy, offload. Otherwise stay on CPU. Deterministic mode forces CPU so we keep replay guarantees.

**Tweet 5/9**
GPU unavailable? No crashes. CPU fallback handles everything and logs a warning. Operators can ship the same binary to GPU and non-GPU clusters.

**Tweet 6/9**
Telemetry built-in: counters for GPU launches, fallbacks, average batch size. Monitoring will tell us if GPU work actually pays off.

**Tweet 7/9**
Security plan baked in: interface requires zeroing buffers post-execution. Sensitive embeddings will not linger in device memory.

**Tweet 8/9**
When Milestone 11 rolls around, CUDA kernels just implement the trait. No API churn. No regressions for CPU users.

**Tweet 9/9**
Good engineering is about scaffolding. Task 009 is the scaffold for Engram's GPU future.

## Bonus Thread: Why Not Wait?

**Tweet 1/4**
Waiting until GPU kernels exist leads to rushed designs and risky refactors. Interface-first keeps CPU path stable.

**Tweet 2/4**
Cross-team coordination improves. GPU engineers know exactly what to build; platform engineers can wire observability today.

**Tweet 3/4**
Feature flags ship early so customers can prepare hardware, drivers, and monitoring.

**Tweet 4/4**
Future-proofing is cheaper than rewrite. Trait-based design lets us support CUDA now, HIP later, without touching recall logic.
