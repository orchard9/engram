## Research Findings

### GPU Suitability for Activation Spreading
Vector similarity and batched activation accumulation map well to GPUs: thousands of independent dot products and reductions can be executed with high occupancy. Projects like FAISS demonstrate 5×–10× speedups for vector search using CUDA kernels (Johnson et al., 2017). Gunrock shows how graph traversal can be structured in phases to maximize GPU utilization (Wang et al., 2016). Our spreading kernel can follow similar patterns: gather neighbors, compute activation contributions, scatter updates.

### Memory Transfer Strategies
Unified Memory simplifies programming by automatically migrating pages between CPU and GPU, but page faults introduce unpredictable latency. NVIDIA recommends explicit pinned memory for throughput-critical batch transfers, achieving up to 12 GB/s on PCIe 4.0 (NVIDIA, 2023). We should design `GPUActivationBatch` to pack embeddings and activation arrays contiguously, enabling `cudaMemcpyAsync` to move the entire batch in one call. For small batches (<64 vectors), transfer overhead dominates, so CPU fallback remains preferable.

### Dispatch and Fallback
The adaptive engine should measure batch size and GPU availability before offloading. CUDA context creation can take tens of milliseconds, so we should initialize contexts lazily and cache them (Volkov, 2016). When GPU execution fails (e.g., kernel launch error, device lost), we must fall back to CPU seamlessly and log the incident. Dispatch heuristics can evolve, but the interface should expose telemetry (kernel duration, transfer time, occupancy estimates) so Task 010 can monitor performance.

### Semantic Parity
GPU kernels often use fused multiply-add with higher precision than CPU scalar code, leading to slight numerical differences. To maintain parity, we should accumulate in `f32` but optionally support `f64` accumulation for determinism. Cross-device tests compare outputs with ULPS tolerances. Deterministic mode may disable GPU kernels to guarantee byte-identical results; the API should make that switch easy.

### Future-Proofing
CUDA is the near-term target, but designing the interface around a trait allows plugging in HIP or Vulkan compute later. Build scripts should gate CUDA compilation behind a `gpu` feature. Observability requires hooks into `nvml` (device utilization, memory usage) and kernel-level tracing to feed monitoring dashboards. Security audits remind us to zero GPU buffers after use if they may contain sensitive data (Zhou et al., 2018).
