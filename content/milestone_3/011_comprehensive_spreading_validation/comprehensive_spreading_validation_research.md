## Research Findings

### Graph Testing Strategies
Deterministic test graphs (chains, cycles, trees, cliques) reveal logical errors quickly. Property-based frameworks like `proptest` can generate thousands of random graphs, ensuring termination and monotonic decay hold across diverse structures (Claessen & Hughes, 2000). For large graphs, we use scalable generators (Barabási–Albert) to mimic real-world degree distributions (Barabási & Albert, 1999).

### Performance Regression Infrastructure
Criterion provides statistically rigorous benchmarking with outlier detection using bootstrapping (Heath, 2018). Divan enables async-friendly benchmarking, aligning with Tokio. Pinning benchmarks to dedicated CPU cores and disabling Turbo Boost reduces variance (De Moura & Bjørner, 2011). Tracking histograms of P95 latency helps enforce SLAs; CI can flag regressions when P95 increases beyond tolerance.

### Cognitive Experiment Replication
Classic semantic priming shows faster recognition for semantically related words (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971). Our spreading engine should reflect this by boosting activation for `NURSE` when seeded with `DOCTOR`. The fan effect shows that nodes with many outgoing links distribute activation more thinly (Anderson, 1974). Delay-based decay curves should approximate exponential forgetting functions measured in cognitive psychology (Wixted, 1990). Validating these effects demonstrates cognitive plausibility.

### Concurrency Safety
Lock-free data structures demand rigorous validation. Tools like `loom` explore possible interleavings to catch race conditions (Smith & Grossman, 2019). Running tests with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers` and sanitizers (ASan, TSAN) catches undefined behavior. Long-running soak tests with telemetry observe memory usage trends to spot leaks.

### Observability Coupling
Validation results should feed into dashboards. Recording benchmark results and latency predictions into JSON artifacts allows trend analysis. Linking test suites with production metrics ensures parity: if production latency rises, corresponding regression tests should replicate the issue locally.
