## Thread: Certifying Cognitive Spreading Before Every Release

**Tweet 1/10**
Spreading activation drives recall now. Task 011 builds the validation gauntlet that every release must pass before we ship.

Start with deterministic fixtures: chains, cycles, trees, fan-effect graphs. Deterministic mode + snapshot tests make regression diffs obvious.

Property-based tests generate random graphs and enforce invariants: termination, monotonic decay, confidence bounds. Counterexamples shrink automatically.

Cognitive realism gets automated checks. Semantic priming, fan effect, and exponential decay experiments run as integration tests (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Anderson, 1974; Wixted, 1990).

Performance benchmarks lock in <10 ms P95. Criterion + Divan capture latency and throughput while recording perf counters for cache behavior.

Stress suite builds 1M-node scale-free graphs and launches 100 concurrent spreads. Memory growth stays bounded; pools from Task 010 prove their worth.

Loom and sanitizers hunt for race conditions. Deterministic replay plus loom ensures lock-free structures behave under every interleaving.

Validation outputs flow into Prometheus. If a nightly benchmark slips, dashboards light up before customers notice.

**Tweet 9/10**
Run everything with `cargo test -p engram-core --features full_validation` and `cargo bench --bench spreading`. Failures come with deterministic repro instructions.

We do not just hope spreading worksâ€”we prove it, every day.

## Bonus Thread: Maintaining the Suite

**Tweet 1/4**
Update cognitive fixtures when new research refines activation curves.

**Tweet 2/4**
Archive benchmark artifacts for trend analysis. Regression detection needs history.

**Tweet 3/4**
Keep stress graphs realistic: refresh scale-free seeds and include real-world datasets.

**Tweet 4/4**
Validation is a product feature. Treat it with the same rigor as recall itself.
