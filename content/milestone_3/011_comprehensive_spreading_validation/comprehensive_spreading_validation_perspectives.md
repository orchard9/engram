# Comprehensive Spreading Validation Perspectives

## Multiple Architectural Perspectives on Task 011: Comprehensive Spreading Validation

### Verification & Testing Perspective

We build a tiered validation suite:
1. **Deterministic fixtures** – canonical graphs with expected activation traces stored as golden snapshots.
2. **Property tests** – random graphs ensuring invariants (termination, monotonic decay) hold.
3. **Performance regression** – Criterion and Divan benchmarks guarding latency targets.
4. **Cognitive experiments** – automated replicas of semantic priming and fan effect.

Deterministic mode (Task 006) is mandatory for reproducible snapshots. Golden traces live under `engram-core/tests/data/spreading_snapshots/`.

### Cognitive-Architecture Perspective

Validation encodes psychological experiments. For example, semantic priming replicates Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971) by verifying activation spreads more strongly from `DOCTOR` to `NURSE` than to unrelated concepts. Fan effect tests confirm aggregated activation shrinks as associative fan grows. Decay curve tests compare hop-based decay to exponential forgetting constants (~0.3 per hop) observed in lab studies (Wixted, 1990).

### Systems Architecture Perspective

Performance validation must mirror production hardware. Benchmarks pin threads, warm caches, and record perf counters. Stress tests with 1M-node scale-free graphs run nightly to ensure memory pools from Task 010 remain stable. Monitoring integration exports benchmark results to Prometheus via pushgateway so dashboards highlight regressions immediately.

### Rust Graph Engine Perspective

Test harness utilities build graphs quickly with zero-cost abstractions. We provide builders for chains, trees, cycles, semantic networks, and scale-free graphs. Each returns deterministic IDs so snapshots remain stable. Async tests run on Tokio's multi-threaded runtime; we guard against `loom` limitations by providing smaller deterministic harnesses for concurrency proofs.

### Technical Communication Perspective

Documentation describes how to run the full validation suite (`cargo test --package engram-core --features full_validation`) and how to interpret outputs. Engineers investigating regressions can replay failing cases with deterministic seeds and inspect stored activation snapshots and metrics.
