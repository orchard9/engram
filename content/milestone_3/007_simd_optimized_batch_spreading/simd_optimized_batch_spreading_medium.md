# SIMD-Optimized Batch Spreading: Making Activation Vector-Friendly

*Perspective: GPU-Acceleration Architect*

Engram's cognitive spreading engine spends most of its time computing cosine similarities and updating activation vectors. Each query touches thousands of 768-dimensional embeddings. Scalar code leaves half of the CPU's execution units idle. Task 007 squeezes that idle capacity by reorganizing data and kernels for SIMD execution—laying the groundwork for future GPU offload while delivering immediate 2× speedups on CPU.

## Aligning Data Layout with Vector Lanes
The first step was transposing our embedding storage from array-of-structures (AoS) to array-of-structures-of-arrays (AoSoA). We tile embeddings in groups of 32. Within each tile, component `k` of every embedding lives contiguously in memory, so a single AVX load fetches the same component for eight embeddings:

```rust
#[repr(align(64))]
pub struct EmbeddingTile {
    pub lanes: [[f32; LANE_WIDTH]; TILE_DIM]; // TILE_DIM = 32, LANE_WIDTH = 8 for AVX2
}
```

This layout keeps cache lines hot and matches the warp layout we plan to use on GPUs. When the CPU pipeline prefetches the next tile, the GPU kernel will benefit too.

## Vectorized Cosine Similarity
We reuse the `compute::cosine_similarity_768` kernel introduced earlier but extend it to operate on batches. The kernel loads the source embedding once, then streams through the tile lanes accumulating dot products with fused multiply-add (FMA):

```rust
fn cosine_simd(source: &[f32; 768], tile: &EmbeddingTile) -> [f32; TILE_DIM] {
    let mut dot = Simd::<f32, LANES>::splat(0.0);
    let mut norm_src = Simd::<f32, LANES>::splat(0.0);
    let mut norm_tgt = Simd::<f32, LANES>::splat(0.0);
    for chunk in 0..(768 / LANES) {
        let s = Simd::from_slice(&source[chunk * LANES..]);
        let t = tile.load_lane(chunk);
        dot = dot + s * t;
        norm_src = norm_src + s * s;
        norm_tgt = norm_tgt + t * t;
    }
    normalize(dot, norm_src, norm_tgt)
}
```

On AVX2-capable hardware, this yields 16 floating-point operations per cycle (Intel, 2023). AVX-512 doubles throughput again, so the same code compiled with nightly Rust's `portable_simd` automatically upgrades to 512-bit lanes.

## Batch Confidence Propagation
Confidence aggregation from Task 004 also benefits from vectorization. After computing similarity scores, we combine them with prior confidence in blocks of 16 values using `_mm256_fmadd_ps` and clamp via `_mm256_min_ps`. Accumulating in `f64` ensures numerical stability, and we apply flush-to-zero to avoid denormals.

## Auto-Tuning at Startup
Not every CPU supports the same instruction set. During server startup we run a warm-up benchmark that measures throughput for batch sizes {8, 16, 32, 64}. We select the best-performing size and cache `CpuFeatures` in a `OnceLock`. On AVX-512 machines the sweet spot tends to be 32 (512-bit lanes × 16 iterations), while on AVX2 the best is often 16 to protect L1 cache residency.

## Benchmarks
Criterion benchmarks on a 12-core Intel Xeon Gold 6338 show:
- Scalar baseline: 4.3 ms to process 10,000 embeddings
- AVX2 batch kernel (batch 16): 2.0 ms (2.15× speedup)
- AVX-512 kernel (batch 32): 1.1 ms (3.9× speedup)

L1 miss rates dropped from 22% to 8% thanks to the AoSoA layout. IPC climbed from 0.9 to 1.7, confirming the compute pipeline stays saturated.

## Preparing for GPU Offload
Because we aligned batch layout with GPU warp shape, Task 009 can reuse the same tile abstraction when implementing CUDA kernels. CPU and GPU paths share the same `BatchKernel` trait, so selecting a CUDA-powered kernel becomes a runtime decision when the GPU backend is ready.
