# Production Integration and Monitoring Perspectives

## Multiple Architectural Perspectives on Task 012: Production Integration and Monitoring

### Systems Architecture Perspective

Monitoring hooks must stay off the hot path. We batch metric updates, using atomic counters for high-frequency events and async tasks for histogram samples. Health checks run on a dedicated runtime worker so failures do not block recall threads. Circuit breakers integrate with existing error recovery: when the breaker opens, recall falls back to similarity-only mode and raises alerts.

### Verification & Testing Perspective

Monitoring code needs tests too. We simulate failure bursts to ensure the circuit breaker transitions correctly, and we use `tokio::time::pause` to fast-forward timers. Chaos tests drop synthetic errors into the spreading engine; metrics and alerts must detect the degradation promptly. For auto-tuning, we run replay traces to confirm parameter adjustments stay within guardrails.

### Technical Communication Perspective

Runbooks explain each metric, alert, and remediation step. Example: "spreading_latency_high" instructs on checking CPU saturation, reviewing batch size, and possibly enabling deterministic mode for diagnosis. Dashboards include annotations for incident timelines, tying Engram metrics to user-facing symptoms.

### Systems Product Planner Perspective

Monitoring data informs roadmap decisions. By tracking adoption of spreading vs. similarity fallback, we know when to prioritize further optimization. Auto-tuning logs become feedback for capacity planning. The feature flag strategy ensures customers can opt into monitoring gradually while ensuring compliance with enterprise observability standards.
