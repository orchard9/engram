## Thread: Keeping Cognitive Spreading Healthy in Production

**Tweet 1/9**
Spreading activation is powerful, but in production you need guardrails. Task 012 wired Engram into Prometheus, health checks, and circuit breakers.

Metrics now cover latency, throughput, cycle detection, and memory pool utilization. Charts show P95 per tier so we catch hot-tier regressions fast.

Health checker runs a synthetic spread every 10 seconds. Non-zero activation and <50 ms latency = healthy. Miss that three times and the probe reports degraded.

Circuit breaker watches failure rate + latency. Trip it and recall falls back to similarity mode instantly. Half-open probes verify recovery before reopening.

Auto-tuner reviews metrics every five minutes. If batch size tweaks promise >10% improvement (and stay within guardrails), it applies the change and logs the decision.

Grafana dashboard highlights latency percentiles, per-tier throughput, pool utilization, and breaker state. Alerts fire when P95 >10 ms or the breaker opens for 30 s.

Instrumentation stays off the hot path: atomics for counters, background tasks for histograms. Monitoring overhead stays <2%.

Runbooks link each alert to actions: check CPU saturation, inspect auto-tuner changes, toggle deterministic mode for deeper diagnosis.

Now Engram’s cognitive recall is not just fast—it is observable, resilient, and tunable in real time.

## Bonus Thread: Operating Tips

**Tweet 1/4**
Export metrics to your enterprise Prometheus and tag dashboards with release versions.

**Tweet 2/4**
Keep the circuit breaker thresholds conservative at launch; relax them once you trust the new spreading engine.

**Tweet 3/4**
Review auto-tuner change logs during postmortems. Adaptive systems need guardrails and human oversight.

**Tweet 4/4**
Production readiness is not an afterthought. Instrumentation is part of the feature.
