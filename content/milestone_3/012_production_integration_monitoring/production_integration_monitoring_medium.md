# Production Integration & Monitoring: Operating Cognitive Spreading Safely

*Perspective: Systems Architecture*

Engram's spreading engine is now powerful and fast, but production readiness depends on how well we observe and control it. Task 012 instrumented the engine with metrics, health checks, circuit breakers, and auto-tuning so operators can trust it in live environments.

## Metrics: Seeing the Right Signals
We registered a `SpreadingMetrics` bundle with Prometheus, capturing latency histograms, throughput counters, quality gauges, and resource utilization. Key signals:
- `engram_spreading_latency_seconds{tier="hot"}` for P95 monitoring
- `engram_cycle_detection_rate_total` to spot pathological loops
- `engram_memory_pool_utilization` to warn about pool exhaustion

Metric updates avoid hot-path overhead by using atomic counters and deferring histogram writes to background tasks.

## Health Checks: Proactive Confidence
A new health checker builds a tiny synthetic graph and runs a two-hop spread every 10 seconds. It validates non-zero activation and sub-50 ms latency. Failures increment a counter; after three consecutive misses the checker reports `Degraded`, after five it declares `Unhealthy`. Kubernetes readiness probes consume this endpoint, ensuring traffic shifts away when spreading falters.

## Circuit Breaker: Graceful Degradation
We implemented a three-state circuit breaker inspired by *Release It!* (Nygard, 2007). When failure rate exceeds 5% or latency spikes above budget, the breaker opens. All recall requests switch to similarity fallback during the cooldown. After the timeout, the breaker enters Half-Open and allows five trial spreads. Success closes it; failure reopens it. Alerts fire whenever the breaker changes state.

## Auto-Tuning: Closing the Loop
An `SpreadingAutoTuner` analyzes recent workload stats—latency, hop counts, tier mix—and proposes parameter adjustments (batch size, hop limit, time budget). Recommendations apply only if predicted improvement exceeds 10% and parameters stay within guardrails. Changes are logged with structured context so operators can audit and revert if needed. The tuner runs at most once every five minutes to avoid oscillation.

## Dashboards and Alerts
Grafana dashboards visualize latency percentiles, throughput per tier, pool utilization, cycle detection rate, and circuit breaker status. Recording rules compute five-minute failure rates for alerting. Alerts trigger on:
- P95 latency >10 ms for 2 minutes
- Failure rate >0.1/min for 1 minute
- Circuit breaker open for >30 seconds

Runbooks tie each alert to actionable diagnostics and remediation steps.

## Putting It All Together
With metrics flowing, health checks probing, breakers guarding, and auto-tuning adapting, Engram’s spreading engine graduates to production-grade reliability. Operators gain confidence that cognitive recall remains fast, accurate, and observable—even under stress.
