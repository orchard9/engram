# Production Integration and Monitoring Research

> Update (2025-10-09): Engram now emits metrics through its internal streaming/log pipeline. The Prometheus discussions below describe legacy adapters and should be treated as optional extensions layered on the streaming feed.

## Research Topics for Milestone 3 Task 012: Production Integration and Monitoring

### 1. Observability for Cognitive Systems
- Metrics for graph activation latency, throughput, and quality
- Distributed tracing of spreading operations
- High-cardinality labels and cardinality control
- Histogram vs. summary choices for latency measurement
- Alerting based on SLO/SLA paradigms

### 2. Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns
- Open/close/half-open state machines (Nygard, 2007)
- Failure thresholds and cooldown strategies
- Interaction with retry/backoff policies
- Fallback strategies for degraded service levels
- Chaos testing techniques for resilience validation

### 3. Health Checks and Readiness Probes
- Liveness vs. readiness semantics in stateful systems
- Canaries and deep health checks for complex dependencies
- Impact of health check frequency on system load
- Progressive degradation and partial availability
- Observing health trends over time

### 4. Auto-Tuning and Adaptive Control
- Feedback control loops (PID, EWMA) in systems management
- Data collection requirements for tuning decisions
- Stability analysis to avoid oscillation
- Safety constraints and guardrails for parameter changes
- Operator override and rollback workflows

### 5. Monitoring Tooling and Deployment
- Prometheus metrics best practices (recording rules, alerting)
- Grafana dashboard design for cognitive workloads
- Integration with incident response pipelines (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- Secret management for monitoring endpoints
- Documentation and runbooks for on-call engineers

## Research Findings

### Observability Fundamentals
Cognitive spreading introduces metrics beyond typical database systems: hop counts, confidence distributions, cycle detection rates. Histograms provide percentiles for latency, but high-cardinality labels (e.g., memory IDs) must be avoided to prevent Prometheus blowups (Turnbull, 2018). Instead we label by tier, mode, and status only. The Google SRE model suggests alerting on budget burn rather than raw latency breaches to avoid flapping (Beyer et al., 2016). However, for P95 < 10 ms, a direct threshold alert remains practical.

### Circuit Breaker Design
Michael Nygard's *Release It!* popularized circuit breakers as protection against cascading failures (Nygard, 2007). Closed/Open/Half-Open states with exponential backoff and limited half-open probes minimize risk. The breaker should monitor both failure rate and latency spikes; combining them prevents "slow" successes from exhausting resources. Integration with Engram's error recovery means that when the breaker trips, recall falls back to similarity mode immediately.

### Health Checks
Shallow health checks ("is the process up?") are insufficient. Deep checks perform actual spreading operations on synthetic graphs to validate correctness and latency. Kubernetes readiness probes can call `GET /health/spreading`, returning `200 OK` only when the synthetic spread meets latency and activation thresholds. Run frequency must balance detection speed with overhead; every 10 seconds is a reasonable default.

### Auto-Tuning Strategies
Adaptive control loops must avoid oscillation. EWMA-based controllers with minimum intervals and improvement thresholds ensure stability (Hellerstein et al., 2004). Auto-tuning should propose parameter changes (batch size, hop limit, time budget) based on observed latency and success rates. Operators need audit logs of applied changes and the ability to revert quickly. Safety guardrails keep parameters within proven ranges.

### Monitoring Tooling
Prometheus integrates easily with Rust via `prometheus` crate. Metrics registration should happen once at startup; per-request instrumentations use async-friendly counters/gauges. Grafana dashboards highlight latency percentiles, pool utilization, and circuit breaker state. Recording rules compute derived metrics like failure rates over 5-minute windows. Runbooks document response steps when alerts fire, aligning with SRE best practices (Beyer et al., 2016).
