# Documentation and API Stabilization Perspectives

## Multiple Architectural Perspectives on Task 013: Documentation and API Stabilization

### Technical Communication Perspective

Docs follow the Diátaxis structure: tutorials (getting started with recall), how-to guides (tuning performance, enabling monitoring), explanations (cognitive principles), and reference (API signatures). Each section cross-links to code examples and monitoring dashboards. Visuals include activation flow diagrams generated by the new `SpreadingVisualizer`.

### Systems Product Planner Perspective

API stabilization requires versioning and deprecation policies. We tag the spreading API as "beta" until Milestone 4, track config changes in a changelog, and provide migration steps. Feature flags let customers choose between similarity-only, spreading, or hybrid modes. Documentation explains roadmap phases so stakeholders understand future compatibility.

### Rust Graph Engine Perspective

Examples live under `examples/` and compile as part of CI (`cargo test --doc`, `cargo run --example ...`). Rustdoc comments annotate configuration structs with both cognitive meaning and performance impact. The visualizer tool integrates with `cargo xtask` for quick generation of DOT graphs.

### Verification & Testing Perspective

Documentation accuracy is tested: doctests run automatically, examples executed in CI, and visualization outputs validated via snapshot tests. Performance tuning recommendations reference benchmark results recorded in Task 011 to ensure alignment.
