## Thread: Making Cognitive Recall Understandable

**Tweet 1/9**
Spreading activation is wired into Engram, but docs turn it into something teams can actually use. Task 013 delivered the playbook.

Docs now follow Diátaxis: tutorials to enable spreading, how-to guides for tuning, explanations for cognitive theory, reference for every config knob (Kostecki, 2020).

API fields come with dual meaning: tech + cognitive. `max_hop_count` = branching factor growth + associative distance. `decay_rate` = runtime cost + forgetting curve tie-in.

Three runnable examples ship under `examples/`: semantic priming, episodic reconstruction, confidence-guided exploration. CI runs them so they never rot.

Performance tuning guide gives presets for low-latency, high-recall, and balanced modes. Each recommendation links to benchmark numbers from Task 011.

New `SpreadingVisualizer` outputs GraphViz DOT files. Color-coded nodes show activation strength; edge thickness shows confidence. Debugging spreads just got visual.

Docs-as-code pipeline linted, doctested, and versioned. Every API change updates reference tables and changelog entries.

**Tweet 8/9**
Stability levels documented: spreading API marked beta until Milestone 4, GPU hooks flagged experimental. Users know what is safe to rely on.

Engineering is only half the work. Documentation makes cognitive recall accessible to everyone else.

Use the tuning guide alongside monitoring dashboards from Task 012—docs point to the exact metrics to watch.

Commit the visualization tool output with PRs; reviewers understand spreading changes instantly.
