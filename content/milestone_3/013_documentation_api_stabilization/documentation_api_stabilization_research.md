# Documentation and API Stabilization Research

## Research Topics for Milestone 3 Task 013: Documentation and API Stabilization

### 1. Cognitive System Documentation Practices
- Explaining cognitive principles to developers
- Mapping psychological concepts to API parameters
- Visual aids for activation flow diagrams
- Narrative examples that illustrate priming and recall
- Maintaining consistency across docs, examples, and code

### 2. API Stability and Versioning
- Semantic versioning for experimental features
- Feature flags and capability negotiation in APIs
- Deprecation policies and communication plans
- Documentation automation (Rustdoc, mdBook)
- Continuous validation of examples and snippets

### 3. Developer Experience for Cognitive Databases
- Sample applications demonstrating recall patterns
- Debugging tooling (visualizers, trace inspectors)
- Performance tuning guides and decision trees
- Onboarding checklists for new contributors
- Integration with monitoring dashboards for dev feedback

### 4. Visualization Techniques
- GraphViz for activation paths
- Sankey diagrams for activation mass flow
- Interactive notebooks for recall explorations
- Embedding visualizations (UMAP, t-SNE) to show cue relationships
- Tooling integration (CLI, web dashboards)

### 5. Documentation Frameworks and Automation
- Diátaxis framework (tutorials, how-to, explanation, reference)
- Documentation linting and review workflows
- Continuous deployment of docs with version tagging
- Code examples as tests (`rustdoc` doctests, `cargo run --example`)
- Accessibility considerations (color palettes, alt text)

## Research Findings

### Explaining Cognitive Concepts in Developer Docs
Developers need practical explanations linking cognitive science to system behavior. Research on cognitive architectures emphasizes the importance of analogies and visualizations to convey abstract ideas (Newell, 1990). Documentation should pair each parameter with both computational and cognitive meaning—for example, `max_hop_count` relates to associative distance in semantic networks.

### API Stability Strategies
APIs exposed to users must communicate stability levels. Semantic versioning combined with feature flags allows experimental features (like GPU acceleration) to be marked clearly (Preston-Werner, 2013). Rust's documentation tooling supports `#[doc(cfg(feature = "spreading"))]` annotations to indicate feature-gated APIs. Including changelog entries and migration notes helps users navigate updates.

### Examples and Tutorials
Diátaxis recommends separating tutorials (guided learning), how-to guides (goal-oriented), explanations (conceptual), and reference material (API surface) (Kostecki, 2020). Engram docs should follow this: tutorials for basic recall, how-to for performance tuning, explanations for cognitive theory, and reference for API signatures. Examples should be runnable with `cargo run --example ...` and validated in CI to prevent drift.

### Visualization Tooling
GraphViz DOT output remains a lightweight way to visualize activation paths. Activation magnitude can map to color intensity; confidence determines edge width. For deeper analysis, integrate with `netron` or `d3.js` for interactive views. Ensuring color palettes meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) maintains usability (W3C, 2018).

### Documentation Automation
Continuous documentation deployment (Docs-as-Code) uses CI pipelines that lint Markdown, run doctests, and publish updates. Tools like `rustdoc --cfg` and `mdbook` integrate with existing Rust workflows. Automated link checking and style linting (Vale, markdownlint) keep docs high quality.
