## Research Findings

### Cycle Detection Foundations
Depth-first search remains the canonical approach for cycle detection in directed graphs through back-edge identification, achieving linear time complexity \(O(|V| + |E|)\) (Tarjan, 1972). Johnson's algorithm delivers efficient enumeration of all simple cycles with \(O((|C|+1)(|V| + |E|))\) complexity for sparse graphs, making it practical when we need to classify recurring patterns rather than only detect their existence (Johnson, 1975). More recent work on dynamic graphs emphasizes incremental approaches that maintain cycle summaries as edges are added or removed, especially in large streaming systems (Bender et al., 2019). For our activation engine, we focus on bounded-hop detection: we only care about cycles encountered within the spreading horizon (typically 5â€“7 hops). This allows us to cap memory growth while still guaranteeing termination.

### Termination Guarantees for Spreading Activation
Theoretical analyses of spreading activation model the process as an energy-dissipating system where activation values decrease exponentially with hop count (Anderson, 1983). When decay coefficients satisfy \(0 < \lambda < 1\), activation sums remain finite even on cyclic graphs, but in practice floating-point precision and concurrent updates can accumulate error. Cognitive models introduce refractory periods or inhibitory gates after repeated visits to prevent runaway loops (Collins & Loftus, 1975). In our tier-aware setting, we combine explicit hop limits, per-tier activation thresholds, and adaptive damping factors. A proof sketch: define the activation state vector \(a_t\) after hop \(t\). Each iteration multiplies by a transition matrix \(W\) with \(\|W\|_1 \leq \lambda\). Adding a penalty \(p\) after each revisit ensures \(a_t \rightarrow 0\) even if \(\lambda=1\), because the penalty injects a negative term bounded away from zero. This matches the convergence criteria used in semantic network simulation literature (Quillian, 1969).

### Concurrent Visit Tracking Strategies
DashMap offers lock sharding with atomic operations, balancing write-heavy loads common in activation spreading (Biaudet & DashMap Maintainers, 2023). However, the cost of allocating new entries per visit can be high. Epoch-based reclamation (EBR) avoids ABA issues when removing stale visit records in concurrent contexts (Herlihy & Shavit, 2012). Hybrid structures pair a probabilistic Bloom filter (Broder & Mitzenmacher, 2004) to catch first-time visits cheaply, only populating DashMap when the Bloom filter indicates a potential revisit. This reduces cache-line contention under high-degree nodes. Visit records should remain 32 bytes or less to fit comfortably within a cache line alongside metadata; we can pack hop count, visit count, and tier metadata into 2-byte fields.

### Confidence Penalties and Cognitive Plausibility
Studies on semantic memory demonstrate that repeated traversal of the same associative loop leads to lower subjective confidence, even if the retrieved fact remains correct (Nelson & Narens, 1990). Introducing an adaptive penalty mimics inhibitory control mechanisms observed in prefrontal cortex circuits that suppress perseveration (Miller & Cohen, 2001). Our penalty should scale with both hop count and revisit count: \(penalty = base\_penalty \times hop\_factor \times revisit\_factor\). Empirical data from spreading activation experiments suggests base penalties between 0.05 and 0.15 maintain stability without extinguishing useful reinforcement (Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). The penalty also serves as a metacognitive flag to downstream ranking components that a path traversed a cycle, allowing them to de-prioritize potentially redundant evidence.

### Observability and Cycle Metrics
Effective debugging demands surfacing cycle-related metrics: total cycles encountered per spread, maximum cycle length, average penalty applied, and time spent in cycle detection. Graph telemetry systems often rely on strongly connected component (SCC) extraction to summarize cycle-heavy regions (Tarjan, 1972). Instrumentation should expose per-tier statistics to highlight imbalances, such as warm-tier graphs exhibiting excessive cycles due to partially consolidated memories. Visualization of cycles via flame-graph-like representations helps analysts trace activation flow (Gregg, 2016). For performance tracking, we target <2% additional CPU time for cycle detection relative to baseline spreading, aligning with results from hybrid Bloom filter + hash map approaches in streaming graph processing (Sangwan et al., 2020).
