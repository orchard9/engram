# Cyclic Graph Protection: Building Cognitive Inhibition into Spreading Activation

*Perspective: Systems Architecture*

Spreading activation sits at the heart of Engram's cognitive query model. When activation traverses the knowledge graph, it explores associations, aggregates confidence, and ultimately surfaces candidate memories. Without guardrails, however, activation can become trapped in cyclic subgraphs, endlessly re-energizing the same cluster. Human brains solve a similar problem through executive control: prefrontal inhibition dampens perseveration while leaving productive search intact (Miller & Cohen, 2001). Task 005 translates that principle into a rigorous systems design.

## Why Cycles Are Dangerous in Tier-Aware Spreading
Engram's tier-aware spreading scheduler (Task 003) already balances hop depth, confidence decay, and resource budgets. Cycles break those assumptions. Once activation enters a strongly connected component, each hop redistributes activation among the same vertices. With floating-point rounding and asynchronous updates, the total activation mass can stabilize above the termination threshold. That leads to unbounded execution time, wasted CPU, and spurious confidence estimates. Worse, the path history becomes polluted with redundant evidence, confusing downstream recall logic.

## Layered Protection Strategy
Cyclic graph protection combines four layers that trade accuracy for performance elegantly:

1. **Probabilistic First-Touch Filter**: A 1% false-positive Bloom filter screens first-time visits. It lives in L1 cache and costs three 64-bit hashes per check, adding ~10ns overhead (Broder & Mitzenmacher, 2004).
2. **Sharded Visit Records**: When the Bloom filter indicates a revisit, we promote the vertex into a sharded DashMap-backed store. Visit records track hop count, tier of first contact, activation snapshot, and visit count with atomic fields.
3. **Adaptive Penalty Engine**: Penalties scale with hop depth and repetition. First revisit applies a 7% activation reduction; each subsequent pass grows by 2%, capped at 35%. Confidence drops at half the activation penalty, flagging metacognitive uncertainty (Nelson & Narens, 1990).
4. **Tier-Specific Hop Limits**: Hot-tier memories accept only three reinforcements, warm tier five, cold tier seven. These limits mirror the complementary learning systems theory—rapid but fragile hippocampal traces versus slower, stable neocortical schemas (McClelland et al., 1995).

Together, the layers guarantee termination within bounded hops while preserving meaningful exploration.

## Implementation Blueprint
Cycle protection integrates at the end of each spreading hop:

```rust
fn apply_cycle_protection(
    hop: HopIndex,
    active: &[ActivationRecord],
    visited: &SharedVisitTable,
    params: &CycleParams,
) {
    active.par_iter().for_each(|record| {
        if let Some(mut visit) = visited.record_visit(record.memory_id, hop) {
            let penalty = params.penalty_curve(visit.visit_count, visit.hop_count);
            record.apply_penalty(penalty);
            if visit.hop_count >= params.max_hops_for_tier(visit.tier) {
                record.deactivate();
            }
        }
    });
}
```

`SharedVisitTable` exposes a deterministic ordering by sorting IDs before penalty application, ensuring test reproducibility. Behind the scenes, per-thread caches batch visit updates to reduce cross-core contention, then flush to shared state at hop boundaries.

## Observability and Feedback
Cycle behavior must be observable. We expose metrics via `metrics::activation`:

- `cycles_detected_total`
- `cycle_penalty_sum`
- `max_cycle_length`
- `cycle_detection_duration_ns`

These feed into the milestone monitoring task (012) to highlight anomalies, such as sudden increases in cycle penalties that signal new graph structures. Additionally, we log sampled cycle traces with memory IDs and tiers to help engineers replay troublesome spreads.

## Testing for Confidence
Two testing pillars validate the design:

1. **Property-Based Graph Generation**: `proptest` produces random graphs with varying clustering coefficients. We assert termination within hop limits and monotonic activation decrease on revisits.
2. **Deterministic Golden Cases**: Hand-crafted graphs (triangle, figure-eight, torus cluster) provide repeatable scenarios. Golden files track expected penalty sequences, ensuring refactors preserve behavior.

Performance tests benchmark overhead: <2% CPU cost and <5µs additional latency per spread on warm tier. Those numbers match published results for hybrid Bloom filter + hash map cycle detection in streaming engines (Sangwan et al., 2020).

## Cognitive Alignment
By synchronizing algorithmic safeguards with cognitive theory, we prevent pathological loops without sterilizing exploratory behavior. The system remains faithful to human memory: recent traces are guarded aggressively against rumination, while consolidated knowledge can be revisited for deeper insight. Termination guarantees keep the engine predictable, and confidence penalties provide metacognitive signals for downstream ranking.

Cyclic graph protection is therefore more than a safety belt. It encodes the brain's own strategy for steering thought away from unproductive loops, preserving both realism and operational reliability.
