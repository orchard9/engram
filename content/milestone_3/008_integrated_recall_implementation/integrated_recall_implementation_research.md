## Research Findings

### Cognitive Recall Foundations
Tulving's distinction between episodic and semantic memory highlights how cues trigger both similarity-based familiarity and context reconstruction (Tulving, 1983). Anderson's spreading activation theory demonstrates that activation emanates from cue representations through associative links, decaying with distance but amplifying through convergent evidence (Anderson, 1983). Hybrid models such as dual-process theories combine a fast familiarity check (vector similarity) with slower recollection processes (graph spreading) (Yonelinas, 2002). Our integrated recall aligns with this: seeding via similarity (familiarity) then spreading (recollection).

### Recall Pipeline Architectures
Modern knowledge graph systems use staged pipelines: candidate generation, evidence aggregation, ranking (Sun et al., 2018). Engram mirrors this pattern: vector seeder → spreading → aggregation → ranking. Time-bounded recall can interrupt spreading when the budget expires, returning partial results. Research on anytime algorithms shows that even partially completed spreading can improve accuracy if ranking accounts for confidence (Dean & Boddy, 1988).

### Confidence Aggregation Strategies
Confidence should combine path evidence and similarity scores. Bayesian model averaging aggregates evidence from multiple paths weighted by reliability (Hoeting et al., 1999). Practical systems often rely on log-odds addition to maintain numerical stability. Calibration is vital: Platt scaling or isotonic regression can calibrate final confidence using validation datasets (Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005). Our aggregator should produce not only confidence values but also diagnostic signals (e.g., number of contributing paths, tiers involved) so integrated recall can surface explanations.

### Performance Considerations
Interactive applications demand low-latency recall. Vector seeding typically costs <1 ms with optimized SIMD. Spreading adds iterative hops; tier-aware scheduling (Task 003) can bound each hop to ~2 ms on warm tier. By setting a 10 ms P95 budget, we can allocate 1 ms to seeding, 7 ms to spreading (3–4 hops), and 2 ms to ranking. If the budget is exhausted early, fallback to similarity ensures the API responds quickly. Caching popular cue embeddings and storing precomputed activation templates for frequent recall flows further reduces latency (Dean, 2013).

### Reliability and Rollout
Production systems adopt feature flags for gradual rollout (Rahman et al., 2019). Integrated recall should default to similarity mode until operators enable spreading per deployment. Canary testing can run both paths simultaneously on a subset of requests, logging divergences in top-k results and confidence. Comprehensive telemetry—precision, recall, activation mass, fallbacks triggered—helps monitor quality.
