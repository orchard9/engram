## Thread: Teaching Engram to Remember Like a Brain

**Tweet 1/11**
Similarity search is fast but shallow. Task 008 upgrades Engram's recall so it feels more like human memoryâ€”familiarity first, then recollection.

We still start with vector seeding. Grab the top-K closest embeddings per tier in ~1 ms. Those seeds ignite the spreading engine.

Spreading activation explores associations under a time budget. Tier-aware scheduling keeps hot-tier hops quick and cold-tier hops cautious.

Cycle protection (Task 005) guarantees termination, while SIMD kernels (Task 007) keep batch activation fast. Deterministic mode (Task 006) lets us replay the path.

Every path contributes evidence: activation, confidence, tier transitions, penalties. We bundle them into `RecallEvidence` objects for aggregation and explainability.

Confidence blends signals:
- Activation mass from spreading
- Original similarity score
- Recency decay
- Tier weights

Calibrated with Milestone 2 datasets.

Ranking sorts by activation, then confidence, then similarity, with a small recency boost. Recent memories win ties, just like human recall (Yonelinas, 2002).

Time budget enforcement matters. If spreading exceeds 10 ms P95, we freeze progress and return partial results. Reliability beats perfection.

Fallback path remains. Flip a feature flag and we can return similarity-only results instantly if spreading stumbles.

Observability: new metrics track mode usage, latency, activation mass, and confidence averages. Structured logs capture the stories behind each recall.

**Tweet 11/11**
Integrated recall is the moment Engram graduates from vector database to cognitive database. Context matters now.

## Bonus Thread: Rolling It Out Safely

Default mode stays `RecallMode::Similarity`. Enable `Hybrid` to run spreading in parallel and compare outputs.

Watch divergence dashboards: how often do top-5 results change? How does confidence shift?

Set alerts on fallback frequency. Fallbacks should be rare and informative.

Document how to capture deterministic traces so support engineers can replay recalls during incidents.

**Tweet 5/5**
Once latency and accuracy targets look good, flip to `Spreading`. Keep the flag around for fast rollback.
