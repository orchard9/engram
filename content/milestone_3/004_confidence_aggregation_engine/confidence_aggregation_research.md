# Confidence Aggregation Research

## Overview

This research document explores the mathematical foundations and biological motivations for confidence aggregation in cognitive memory systems, specifically for Task 004's implementation of a confidence aggregation engine in Engram.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Probabilistic Aggregation Methods

#### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
The core principle for aggregating independent confidence paths:

```
P(correct | multiple paths) = 1 - ∏(1 - P_i(correct))
```

Where each P_i represents the confidence from path i. This assumes independence between paths, which approximates biological memory recall where different associative chains provide independent evidence.

**Derivation:**
- P(all paths wrong) = ∏(1 - P_i)
- P(at least one path correct) = 1 - P(all paths wrong)
- This gives us the MLE aggregation formula

**Properties:**
- Always yields confidence ≥ max(individual confidences)
- Bounded in [0,1] range
- Diminishing returns: adding more paths yields smaller confidence gains
- Handles heterogeneous confidence values naturally

#### Weighted Bayesian Aggregation
Alternative approach using Bayesian inference with path weights:

```
P(correct | evidence) = ∑(w_i * P_i) / ∑(w_i)
```

Where w_i = reliability_weight * distance_weight * tier_weight

**Advantages:**
- Incorporates path quality explicitly
- More conservative than MLE
- Easier to reason about individual contributions

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires careful weight calibration
- May underestimate confidence when paths are truly independent

### Distance-Based Decay Functions

#### Exponential Decay
Models signal attenuation in neural networks:

```
confidence_decayed = confidence_original * exp(-λ * hop_count)
```

Parameters:
- λ (decay_rate): Controls how quickly confidence decreases with distance
- Typical values: 0.1-0.3 for cognitive systems
- Based on studies of synaptic signal attenuation

#### Inverse Distance Weighting
Alternative simpler approach:

```
weight = 1 / (1 + hop_count)
```

**Comparison:**
- Exponential decay: More biologically plausible, steeper falloff
- Inverse weighting: Simpler computation, gentler decay
- Engram uses exponential for biological fidelity

### Tier-Aware Confidence Weighting

Each storage tier introduces different uncertainty characteristics:

#### Hot Tier (In-Memory)
- Factor: 1.0 (no degradation)
- Rationale: Direct memory access, no compression artifacts
- Equivalent to working memory in cognitive systems

#### Warm Tier (Memory-Mapped)
- Factor: 0.95 (slight degradation)
- Rationale: Compression artifacts, potential cache misses
- Models short-term memory consolidation effects

#### Cold Tier (Columnar Storage)
- Factor: 0.9 (moderate degradation)
- Rationale: Quantization errors, reconstruction artifacts
- Represents long-term memory with some degradation

### Numerical Stability Considerations

#### Log-Space Arithmetic
For many paths (>10), direct multiplication can cause underflow:

```rust
// Instead of: confidence = 1.0 - (1.0 - p1) * (1.0 - p2) * ...
// Use log-space: log(1 - product) = log(1 - exp(sum(log(1 - p_i))))
let log_complement_product: f32 = paths.iter()
    .map(|p| (1.0 - p.confidence).ln())
    .sum();
let final_confidence = 1.0 - log_complement_product.exp();
```

#### Bounds Checking
Essential for maintaining probabilistic semantics:
- Input validation: All confidences ∈ [0,1]
- Intermediate validation: Check for NaN, infinity
- Output clamping: Ensure result ∈ [0,1]

## Biological Motivation

### Neural Signal Integration

#### Hippocampal Pattern Completion
The hippocampus integrates partial cues from multiple cortical areas:
- Each cortical input provides evidence with varying confidence
- Integration follows roughly maximum likelihood principles
- Distance from original encoding affects signal quality

#### Synaptic Reliability
Individual synapses have probabilistic transmission:
- Each synapse has a release probability
- Multiple synaptic inputs combine to determine cell firing
- This naturally implements confidence aggregation

### Memory Consolidation Studies

#### Multiple Trace Theory
Research by Lynn Nadel and others shows:
- Multiple retrieval pathways can reactivate same memory
- Each pathway may have different fidelity
- Confidence aggregation determines recall strength

#### Forgetting Curves
Hermann Ebbinghaus's research on memory decay:
- Confidence decreases with time and interference
- Multiple encoding pathways slow forgetting rate
- Similar to our hop-count based decay

## Conclusion

Confidence aggregation in cognitive systems requires careful balance between mathematical rigor and biological plausibility. The maximum likelihood approach with exponential decay provides a solid foundation that respects both computational efficiency and cognitive science principles. Tier-aware weighting adds necessary realism about storage characteristics while maintaining interpretability.

The key insight is that confidence aggregation isn't just a technical detail—it's fundamental to how cognitive systems handle uncertain evidence from multiple sources. Getting this right enables the kind of graceful degradation and probabilistic reasoning that distinguishes cognitive architectures from traditional databases.
