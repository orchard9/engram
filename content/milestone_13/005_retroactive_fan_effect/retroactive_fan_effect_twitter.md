# Retroactive Fan Effect: Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1/8**
Anderson (1974) discovered the fan effect: each additional association to a concept adds 54ms to retrieval time. Learn "lawyer-park" and recall is 1.11s. Add "lawyer-bank," "lawyer-court" and retrieval slows to 1.27s. More connections = more competition.

The retroactive part is critical: adding new associations today slows retrieval of associations learned yesterday. Not because old memories weaken, but because activation spreads to more targets. Each target gets a smaller slice of limited attentional resources.

Implementation challenge: counting fan during every retrieval is too slow. Solution: atomic fan counters co-located with node metadata. Increment on edge add, decrement on remove. Read with Relaxed ordering gives us O(1) fan lookup in under 5ns.

Reder & Ross (1983) showed fan affects confidence, not just speed. Hit rates drop from 88% (fan 1) to 76% (fan 4). False alarms rise from 12% to 24%. Activation dilution makes it harder to discriminate real memories from plausible lures.

Adaptive retrieval strategy: fan 1-2 gets 3 iterations (fast path), fan 3-5 gets 5 iterations (standard), fan 6+ gets 8 iterations with context-guided selection. Allocate computation where interference is highest, keep average case fast.

Validation requires precise replication: linear RT increase with r > 0.95 correlation (p < 0.001), slope of 50-60ms per fan (95% CI), confidence degradation of 3-5% per increment. Statistical acceptance criteria ensure cognitive plausibility.

Performance numbers: fan counter read in 5ns, retrieval time prediction in 10ns, total overhead 25ns per retrieval. Negligible compared to actual spreading activation costs of 500-800us. Cognitive realism for free.

The fan effect makes Engram's memory realistic: parking locations compete during retrieval, passwords interfere with each other, similar concepts slow down disambiguation. Graph systems that exhibit human-like interference will reason more naturally.
