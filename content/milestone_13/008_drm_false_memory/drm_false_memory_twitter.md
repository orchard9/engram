# DRM False Memory Validation: Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1/8**
Roediger & McDermott (1995) created false memories in the lab: show people "bed, rest, awake, tired, dream" and 58% will confidently "remember" seeing "sleep" - a word never presented. This isn't a bug in human memory. It's a feature we need to replicate in Engram.

The mechanism is semantic convergence: each presented word ("bed," "rest") activates "sleep" through spreading. Repeated activation creates a memory trace indistinguishable from actual experience. Memory is reconstructive, not reproductive. We store relationships, not recordings.

DRM validation tests whether Engram's spreading activation is strong enough to create false memories. Present 15 semantic associates, measure activation of critical lure (never presented), compare to unrelated lures. False recognition should hit 55-65% to match human performance.

Implementation: track which nodes were explicitly encoded vs activated through spreading. Recognition threshold at 0.6 activation level. Test phase measures activation for studied items (true memories), critical lures (false memories), unrelated lures (baseline false alarms).

Critical finding from Roediger: false memory confidence equals true memory confidence. Subjectively, false memories feel real. Our validation requires confidence difference <0.5 on 5-point scale. Activation-to-confidence mapping preserves this equivalence.

Performance: study phase runs real-time (1.5s per word = 22.5s for 15 words), test phase measures 24 activations in 2.4ms sequential, 300us parallel. Statistical validation needs 100+ tests, completes in 90 minutes. Parallelizable across graph instances.

Acceptance criteria: false memory rate 55-65%, true memory rate 72-85%, baseline false alarms <15%, confidence equivalence p > 0.05. Also requires d-prime > 2.0 for critical vs unrelated lures using signal detection theory.

Why this matters: false memories aren't bugs, they're evidence that semantic relationships are strong enough to support analogical reasoning and creativity. Engram hitting 58% false recognition validates that spreading activation achieves human-like associative strength.
