# DRM False Memory Validation: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture Designer

The Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, refined by Roediger & McDermott (1995), provides one of the most robust demonstrations of false memory in cognitive psychology. Subjects study word lists like "bed, rest, awake, tired, dream" (all associates of "sleep") but "sleep" itself is never presented. Yet 55-65% of subjects confidently "remember" seeing "sleep" on the list.

This isn't a flaw in human memory - it's a feature of associative semantic networks. The presented words spread activation to their common associate ("sleep"), creating a memory trace indistinguishable from actual experience. The DRM effect reveals that memory is reconstructive, not reproductive. We don't store perfect records; we store patterns and relationships that can generate false but coherent memories.

From a cognitive architecture perspective, DRM validation tests whether Engram's spreading activation produces the same semantic convergence that creates false memories in humans. If "bed," "rest," "awake," and "tired" all activate "sleep" through spreading, the system should exhibit confidence in "sleep" despite never encoding it directly. The false recall rate should match empirical findings: 55-65% for standard DRM lists.

The biological mechanism involves hippocampal pattern completion. When multiple cues converge on a common representation, the hippocampus CA3 region completes the pattern even if some elements were never experienced. This is normally adaptive (filling gaps in partial memories) but produces false memories when semantic convergence is strong enough.

## Memory Systems Researcher

Roediger & McDermott (1995) established rigorous methodology for DRM testing that our validation must follow:

**Study Phase Protocol:**
- Present 15 words from a semantically associated list
- Presentation rate: 1 word per 1.5 seconds (audio or visual)
- Critical lure (e.g., "sleep") is never presented
- Multiple lists tested to control for individual differences

**Test Phase Protocol:**
- Recognition test with studied items, critical lures, and unrelated lures
- Subjects rate confidence: "Remember" (specific recollection), "Know" (familiarity), "New" (not studied)
- Critical measure: false "Remember" responses to critical lures

**Expected Results:**
- Critical lure false recognition: 55-65% "Remember" responses
- Studied item recognition: 72-85% correct
- Unrelated lure rejection: 88-95% correct
- False recognition confidence often equals or exceeds true recognition confidence

Statistical validation requires:
1. False recognition rate 55-65% (95% CI: [50%, 70%])
2. Difference between critical and unrelated lures: Cohen's d > 1.5 (large effect)
3. Confidence ratings for false memories: M > 4.0 on 5-point scale
4. No significant difference between false and true memory confidence (p > 0.05)

The validation must use standard DRM word lists from Stadler et al. (1999), ensuring comparability with published research. Lists vary in associative strength, allowing testing of dose-response relationship: stronger semantic association should produce higher false memory rates.

## Rust Graph Engine Architect

Implementing DRM validation requires measuring activation convergence on non-presented nodes. The architecture must track which nodes were explicitly encoded versus activated through spreading:

```rust
pub struct DRMValidator {
    /// Presented words (actually encoded)
    studied_items: HashSet<NodeId>,

    /// Critical lures (strong associates, not presented)
    critical_lures: HashSet<NodeId>,

    /// Unrelated lures (control items)
    unrelated_lures: HashSet<NodeId>,

    /// Spreading activation engine
    activation: Arc<SpreadingActivation>,

    /// Activation threshold for "recognition"
    recognition_threshold: f32,
}

impl DRMValidator {
    pub async fn run_drm_test(&self) -> DRMTestResult {
        // Study phase: encode presented words
        for item in &self.studied_items {
            self.activation.encode_node(*item, 0.9).await?;
        }

        // Brief delay (simulating retention interval)
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(30)).await;

        // Test phase: measure activation for all item types
        let mut results = DRMTestResult::new();

        for item in &self.studied_items {
            let activation = self.activation.get_activation(*item).await?;
            results.record_studied_item(activation);
        }

        for lure in &self.critical_lures {
            let activation = self.activation.get_activation(*lure).await?;
            let is_recognized = activation > self.recognition_threshold;
            results.record_critical_lure(activation, is_recognized);
        }

        for lure in &self.unrelated_lures {
            let activation = self.activation.get_activation(*lure).await?;
            results.record_unrelated_lure(activation);
        }

        results
    }
}
```

Performance targets: activation measurement in <100μs per item, full DRM test (15 studied + 1 critical + 8 unrelated = 24 items) completes in <5ms. Memory overhead is minimal since DRM tests use small word lists.

## Systems Architecture Optimizer

The DRM validation creates an opportunity for batch activation queries. Rather than measuring activation for each test item sequentially, we can parallelize across items:

```rust
pub async fn run_drm_test_parallel(&self) -> DRMTestResult {
    // Prepare all test items
    let all_items: Vec<_> = self.studied_items.iter()
        .chain(self.critical_lures.iter())
        .chain(self.unrelated_lures.iter())
        .cloned()
        .collect();

    // Parallel activation measurement
    let activations = stream::iter(all_items)
        .map(|item| async move {
            let activation = self.activation.get_activation(item).await?;
            Ok((item, activation))
        })
        .buffer_unordered(16)  // 16 concurrent queries
        .try_collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .await?;

    // Process results
    let mut results = DRMTestResult::new();
    for (item, activation) in activations {
        if self.studied_items.contains(&item) {
            results.record_studied_item(activation);
        } else if self.critical_lures.contains(&item) {
            results.record_critical_lure(
                activation,
                activation > self.recognition_threshold
            );
        } else {
            results.record_unrelated_lure(activation);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

This parallel approach reduces test time from ~2.4ms (24 items × 100μs) to ~300μs (accounting for 16-way parallelism and coordination overhead). The speedup enables running hundreds of DRM tests for statistical power without excessive runtime cost.
