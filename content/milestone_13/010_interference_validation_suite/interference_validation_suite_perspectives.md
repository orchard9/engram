# Interference Validation Suite: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture Designer

Anderson & Neely (1996) provide the comprehensive framework for validating interference phenomena. Their meta-analysis of 200+ studies establishes that proactive interference, retroactive interference, and fan effects are not independent phenomena - they interact through shared mechanisms of retrieval competition and inhibition.

From a cognitive architecture perspective, a complete interference validation suite must test:
1. **Proactive Interference** (Task 004): prior learning impairs encoding of new associations
2. **Retroactive Fan Effect** (Task 005): adding associations retroactively slows retrieval
3. **Combined Interference**: PI and RI operating simultaneously on the same memory trace
4. **Fan-Interference Interaction**: how fan effects amplify interference from both directions

The biological substrate involves competition for limited hippocampal resources during encoding and prefrontal selection during retrieval. High fan increases competition, amplifying both proactive and retroactive interference. This creates nonlinear interactions where combined interference exceeds the sum of individual effects.

Statistical validation requires factorial designs crossing interference type (PI, RI) with fan level (1-4), measuring both encoding difficulty and retrieval accuracy. Expected interaction: high fan should amplify interference effects by 1.5-2x compared to low fan conditions.

## Memory Systems Researcher

Anderson & Neely (1996) meta-analysis establishes precise effect size expectations:

**Proactive Interference:**
- Encoding penalty: 15-25% reduction in learning rate after 3+ prior lists
- Effect size: d = 0.4-0.6 (medium effect)
- Moderator: similarity of materials (higher similarity → stronger interference)

**Retroactive Interference:**
- Retrieval impairment: 20-30% slower reaction time after learning competing associations
- Effect size: d = 0.5-0.7 (medium to large effect)
- Moderator: time since original learning (recent memories more vulnerable)

**Fan Effect:**
- RT increase: 50-60ms per fan increment
- Effect size: d = 0.6-0.9 (large effect)
- Moderator: strength of associations (weaker associations show larger fan effects)

**Combined Effects:**
- PI + RI: additive or super-additive (total > sum of parts)
- Fan × PI: multiplicative (high fan amplifies proactive interference)
- Fan × RI: multiplicative (high fan amplifies retroactive interference)

Validation suite must test all pairwise interactions with sufficient statistical power (n > 40 per cell for medium effects at p < 0.01).

## Rust Graph Engine Architect

Implementing a comprehensive interference validation suite requires coordinating tests from Tasks 004-005 while measuring interaction effects:

```rust
pub struct InterferenceValidationSuite {
    /// Proactive interference validator (Task 004)
    pi_validator: Arc<ProactiveInterferenceValidator>,

    /// Retroactive fan effect validator (Task 005)
    fan_validator: Arc<FanEffectValidator>,

    /// Memory graph
    graph: Arc<MemoryGraph>,

    /// Test results storage
    results: DashMap<TestCondition, Vec<InterferenceResult>>,
}

#[derive(Hash, Eq, PartialEq, Clone, Debug)]
struct TestCondition {
    interference_type: InterferenceType,
    fan_level: u32,
    prior_learning: u32,
}

impl InterferenceValidationSuite {
    pub async fn run_full_validation(&self) -> ValidationSuiteResults {
        // Factorial design: 2 interference types × 4 fan levels × 3 prior learning levels
        let conditions = self.generate_test_conditions();

        // Run each condition with 20 replications for statistical power
        for condition in conditions {
            for _ in 0..20 {
                let result = self.test_condition(&condition).await?;
                self.results.insert(condition.clone(), result);
            }
        }

        // Analyze results for main effects and interactions
        self.analyze_factorial_design()
    }
}
```

Performance targets: full factorial suite (2 × 4 × 3 × 20 = 480 tests) completes in <2 hours with parallelization.

## Systems Architecture Optimizer

The interference validation suite benefits from massive parallelization - individual test conditions are independent and can run concurrently:

```rust
pub async fn run_full_validation_parallel(&self) -> ValidationSuiteResults {
    let conditions = self.generate_test_conditions();

    // Parallel execution across conditions
    let results = stream::iter(conditions)
        .map(|condition| async move {
            let mut condition_results = Vec::new();
            for _ in 0..20 {
                let result = self.test_condition(&condition).await?;
                condition_results.push(result);
            }
            Ok((condition, condition_results))
        })
        .buffer_unordered(32)  // 32 concurrent test conditions
        .try_collect::<HashMap<_, _>>()
        .await?;

    self.analyze_results(results)
}
```

With 32-way parallelism, 480 tests complete in ~4 minutes instead of 2 hours. Memory overhead scales with parallelism (32 × ~1MB per test = 32MB working set), acceptable for validation workloads.
