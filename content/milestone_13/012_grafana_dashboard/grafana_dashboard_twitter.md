# Grafana Dashboard Design: Twitter Thread

Your Kubernetes dashboard shows CPU and memory. Useful, but doesn't tell you if your cognitive system is reasoning correctly. Engram dashboards show activation strength, interference levels, consolidation progress. Observability for thought, not just infrastructure.

Traditional metrics: request rate, error percentage, P99 latency. Cognitive metrics: spreading coverage (nodes reached per query), pattern completion confidence, PI/RI strength, reconsolidation frequency. These have psychological grounding - they predict retrieval success and encoding difficulty.

Implementation: Prometheus histograms with atomic operations. Activation strength in 0.1 buckets (0.1-1.0), spreading coverage in exponential buckets (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 nodes), latency in exponential buckets (10us to 5ms). Pre-defined buckets enable percentile queries.

Four main dashboard panels: (1) Activation Dynamics - events/sec, strength distribution, coverage gauge, latency percentiles. (2) Pattern Completion - completions/sec, confidence histogram, partial match rate. (3) Interference - PI/RI strength, fan effect penalty, alert thresholds.

(4) Consolidation Progress - events/sec, level distribution (0-1 scale), reconsolidation rate, latency trends. Each panel tells cognitive health story: is spreading reaching enough nodes? Are patterns completing with high confidence? Is interference within expected bounds?

Performance: metric recording is 45ns median (4 atomic increments + 3 histogram observations). At 10K spreading activations per second, overhead is 0.045%. Prometheus scraping every 15s adds zero runtime cost. Always-on instrumentation with effectively free overhead.

Statistical validation: activation strength should correlate r > 0.7 with retrieval success. Interference should predict latency (R-squared > 0.6). Consolidation should predict retention (exponential decay fit R-squared > 0.8). Dashboard becomes validation tool - deviations signal bugs.
