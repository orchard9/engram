# Grafana Dashboard Design: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture Designer

Traditional system dashboards show CPU, memory, request rates. Cognitive dashboards must show spreading activation coverage, pattern completion confidence, interference levels, consolidation throughput. The metrics reflect cognitive health, not just system health.

From a neuroscience perspective, cognitive metrics mirror what fMRI reveals about brain activity: activation patterns, regional connectivity, task-related modulation. A Grafana dashboard becomes a real-time fMRI for Engram, visualizing which memory regions are active, how strongly, and how they interact.

Key visualization requirements:
1. **Activation Heatmaps**: Which nodes are active, at what strength, spatial/temporal patterns
2. **Spreading Coverage**: How far activation propagates, fan-out patterns, boundary conditions
3. **Interference Indicators**: PI/RI strength, competing association counts, resolution times
4. **Consolidation Progress**: Transfer rates, reconsolidation frequency, spacing optimization

The temporal resolution matters: cognitive events happen at microsecond scale but dashboard updates occur at 1-5 second intervals. Aggregation is essential - show trends, percentiles, distributions rather than individual events.

## Memory Systems Researcher

Cognitive metrics must be empirically validated against known behavioral signatures. If the dashboard shows high interference but retrieval accuracy remains high, either the metrics are wrong or the system isn't exhibiting human-like interference effects.

Statistical validation of metrics:
1. **Activation Strength**: Should correlate r > 0.7 with retrieval success probability
2. **Interference Level**: Should predict encoding difficulty and retrieval latency (multiple regression R² > 0.6)
3. **Consolidation Progress**: Should predict retention over time (exponential decay fit R² > 0.8)
4. **Pattern Completion Confidence**: Should calibrate with actual accuracy (Brier score < 0.1)

The dashboard becomes a validation tool: deviations from expected relationships signal implementation bugs or parameter miscalibration. If interference doesn't predict retrieval latency, something is wrong with the fan effect implementation.

## Rust Graph Engine Architect

Implementing cognitive metrics requires efficient aggregation without blocking critical paths. Prometheus metrics with atomic counters and histograms provide the foundation:

```rust
use prometheus::{
    Counter, Histogram, HistogramVec, IntCounter, IntGauge, Registry,
};

pub struct CognitiveMetrics {
    // Activation metrics
    activation_count: IntCounter,
    activation_strength: Histogram,
    spreading_coverage: HistogramVec,

    // Pattern completion metrics
    pattern_completion_count: IntCounter,
    pattern_confidence: Histogram,
    partial_match_rate: Counter,

    // Interference metrics
    interference_events: IntCounter,
    interference_strength: Histogram,
    competing_association_count: HistogramVec,

    // Consolidation metrics
    consolidation_events: IntCounter,
    reconsolidation_rate: Counter,
    consolidation_level: Histogram,
}

impl CognitiveMetrics {
    pub fn record_activation(&self, strength: f32) {
        self.activation_count.inc();
        self.activation_strength.observe(strength as f64);
    }
}
```

Performance targets: metric recording in <50ns (atomic increment + histogram observe), no locks on critical paths, <1% overhead from instrumentation.

## Systems Architecture Optimizer

Dashboard query performance affects observability UX. Prometheus queries should complete in <100ms even with millions of time series. This requires efficient metric aggregation and indexing.

Optimization strategies:
1. **Bucketing**: Pre-aggregate metrics into time buckets (1s, 10s, 1m) for different dashboard refresh rates
2. **Downsampling**: Keep full resolution for recent data (last hour), downsample for historical (last day, week)
3. **Cardinality Control**: Limit label combinations to prevent metric explosion (<10K unique time series)
4. **Recording Rules**: Pre-compute complex queries (percentiles, rates) rather than computing on every dashboard load

Memory footprint: ~1KB per time series × 10K series = 10MB for metrics storage, acceptable for production deployments.
