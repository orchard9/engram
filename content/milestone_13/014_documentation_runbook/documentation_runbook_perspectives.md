# Documentation and Runbook: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture Designer

Operational documentation for cognitive systems differs fundamentally from traditional databases. Instead of "how to tune query performance," operators need "how to calibrate interference thresholds" and "what activation strength indicates healthy spreading."

From a neuroscience perspective, operating a cognitive system is like managing brain health. You don't optimize individual neurons; you maintain healthy activation dynamics, balanced consolidation, appropriate interference levels. Documentation must teach operators to think in cognitive terms.

Key operational concerns:
1. **Activation Calibration**: Ensuring spreading reaches appropriate coverage without runaway cascades
2. **Interference Tuning**: Balancing PI/RI to match application requirements (strict isolation vs flexible association)
3. **Consolidation Scheduling**: Optimizing transfer rates for retention requirements
4. **Memory Pressure**: Recognizing when graph size exceeds cognitive capacity

The documentation must provide decision trees: "If activation coverage drops below X, check Y and adjust Z." Operators need concrete symptoms, root causes, and remediation steps.

## Memory Systems Researcher

Operational documentation must be grounded in empirical validation. Each tuning recommendation should cite the validation metric it affects and the expected impact magnitude.

Example: "Increasing spreading_decay_factor from 0.85 to 0.90 reduces activation coverage by 15-20% (95% CI) while improving precision by 8-12%. Use when false activations exceed 10% of total activations."

The documentation becomes a transfer function from observations to actions, with statistical backing:
- Symptom: High interference (>0.6 mean PI strength)
- Root cause: Insufficient context discrimination
- Remediation: Increase context_shift_threshold from 0.3 to 0.5
- Expected impact: 25-35% reduction in PI strength (p < 0.01)
- Validation: Monitor PI strength metric for 24 hours

This evidence-based approach prevents cargo cult tuning where operators adjust parameters without understanding effects.

## Rust Graph Engine Architect

Implementation runbooks need code examples showing how to query system state and adjust parameters:

```rust
// Check activation health
let coverage = metrics.spreading_coverage.get_sample_sum() / metrics.activation_events.get() as f64;
if coverage < 10.0 {
    // Low coverage - increase spreading iterations
    config.max_spreading_iterations = 5;
} else if coverage > 100.0 {
    // Excessive coverage - increase decay factor
    config.spreading_decay_factor = 0.90;
}

// Monitor interference levels
let pi_strength = metrics.proactive_interference_strength.get_sample_mean();
if pi_strength > 0.6 {
    // High interference - adjust discrimination threshold
    config.context_shift_threshold = 0.5;
}
```

The runbook provides these code snippets as copy-paste templates, reducing time from symptom detection to remediation deployment.

## Systems Architecture Optimizer

Operational runbooks should optimize for MTTR (mean time to recovery), not just MTTF (mean time to failure). This requires:

1. **Fast Symptom Detection**: Dashboard alerts with <1 minute latency
2. **Clear Root Cause Analysis**: Decision trees from symptoms to causes
3. **Automated Remediation**: Scripts for common issues (parameter adjustment, cache clearing, consolidation reset)
4. **Rollback Procedures**: How to revert changes if remediation fails

The documentation should minimize human decision time: "If X then Y" rather than "Consider whether X might indicate Y." Cognitive load on operators should be low, enabling rapid response during incidents.

Pre-baked remediation scripts reduce MTTR from 10-30 minutes (manual investigation + parameter adjustment) to 1-2 minutes (automated detection + one-click fix).
