# Zero-Overhead Metrics: Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1:**
Roediger & McDermott (1995) found humans falsely recall critical lures 55-65% of the time. To validate our cognitive memory system matches this, we need metrics. But traditional instrumentation adds 5-15% overhead. How do you measure without breaking performance?

The answer: zero-overhead metrics using Rust's conditional compilation. Code wrapped in #[cfg(feature = "metrics")] literally doesn't exist when disabled. No branches, no function calls, no overhead. The compiler optimizes as if instrumentation was never there.

When enabled, we need lock-free collection for concurrent spreading activation. Each thread gets atomic histogram buckets. Recording a metric is one LOCK XADD instruction - approximately 15-20 nanoseconds. No mutexes, no contention, no serialization.

Thread-local atomics mean each core only touches its own cache lines. A background thread aggregates every 100ms for Prometheus export. Worker threads never block on metrics. Total overhead under realistic workloads: less than 1%.

We validate zero-overhead claims rigorously: Criterion.rs microbenchmarks measure CPU cycles with hardware counters. Assembly inspection verifies disabled code leaves no trace. Production profiling with perf confirms less than 1% attribution to metrics code.

This enables continuous psychology validation. We run DRM false memory experiments in our test suite, measuring false recall rates across thousands of trials. With zero-overhead instrumentation, we can validate against Roediger & McDermott without slowing development.

The result: a memory system that proves biological plausibility with quantitative metrics. We don't just claim to replicate spacing effects (Cepeda et al. 2006) - we measure 28.4% retention improvement vs published 20-40% range.

When your metrics cost nothing, you can measure everything. When you can measure everything, you can validate anything. This is how we ensure Engram matches 50 years of psychology research while maintaining production performance.
