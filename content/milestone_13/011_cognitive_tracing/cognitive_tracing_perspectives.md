# Cognitive Tracing Infrastructure: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture Designer

Cognitive tracing differs fundamentally from traditional distributed tracing. In microservices, you trace requests across services to understand latency and failures. In cognitive systems, you trace activation cascades across memory structures to understand reasoning paths and pattern completion.

A cognitive trace captures the causal chain: initial activation triggers spreading to neighbors, which triggers pattern completion, which triggers consolidation, which schedules reconsolidation. Each step has timing, strength, and confidence. Understanding why the system reached a particular conclusion requires reconstructing this activation history.

From a neuroscience perspective, this mirrors hippocampal replay. During sleep, the hippocampus reactivates recent experience sequences, strengthening memory traces. Cognitive tracing provides the same capability: replay the activation sequence that led to a decision, identify weak links, optimize spreading parameters.

The temporal dynamics are critical. Spreading activation completes in 500-800μs, pattern completion in 2-5ms, consolidation scheduling in <100μs. Tracing must capture this activity without adding >5% overhead - sub-50ns per trace event.

## Memory Systems Researcher

Traditional observability focuses on system health: CPU usage, request latency, error rates. Cognitive observability focuses on cognitive health: activation strength distributions, pattern completion accuracy, interference levels, consolidation effectiveness.

Key metrics for cognitive systems:
1. **Activation Patterns**: Distribution of activation strengths, decay rates, spreading coverage
2. **Pattern Completion**: Success rates, partial match handling, confidence calibration
3. **Interference Levels**: PI/RI strength, fan effect impact, retrieval competition
4. **Consolidation Quality**: Transfer rates, reconsolidation frequency, spacing optimization

Statistical validation of tracing requires that instrumented systems match uninstrumented performance (overhead <5%, p > 0.05 for latency distributions). Observer effect must be minimized - measuring the system shouldn't change its behavior.

The tracing granularity affects analysis capability. Coarse traces (operation-level) enable aggregate analysis but miss fine details. Fine traces (node-level) enable detailed reconstruction but create data volume challenges. Adaptive sampling provides the balance: trace everything during anomalies, sample during normal operation.

## Rust Graph Engine Architect

Implementing cognitive tracing requires zero-allocation event recording with sub-50ns overhead:

```rust
pub struct CognitiveTracer {
    /// Lock-free event buffer
    events: Arc<SegQueue<TraceEvent>>,

    /// Thread-local event builders (zero-allocation)
    local_builders: ThreadLocal<RefCell<TraceEventBuilder>>,

    /// Sampling rate (1.0 = trace everything, 0.01 = 1% sampling)
    sampling_rate: AtomicF32,

    /// Active trace contexts
    contexts: DashMap<TraceId, TraceContext>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct TraceEvent {
    trace_id: TraceId,
    timestamp: u64,  // Nanoseconds since trace start
    event_type: EventType,
    node_id: Option<NodeId>,
    activation_strength: f32,
    metadata: u64,  // Packed metadata for zero-allocation
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub enum EventType {
    ActivationStart = 0,
    NodeActivated = 1,
    PatternCompleted = 2,
    ConsolidationScheduled = 3,
    ReconsolidationTriggered = 4,
    InterferenceDetected = 5,
}

impl CognitiveTracer {
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn record_activation(&self, trace_id: TraceId, node: NodeId, strength: f32) {
        if !self.should_sample() {
            return;
        }

        let event = TraceEvent {
            trace_id,
            timestamp: self.nanos_since_start(),
            event_type: EventType::NodeActivated,
            node_id: Some(node),
            activation_strength: strength,
            metadata: 0,
        };

        self.events.push(event);
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    fn should_sample(&self) -> bool {
        fastrand::f32() < self.sampling_rate.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }
}
```

Performance targets: event recording in <30ns (lock-free queue push), sampling decision in <5ns (atomic load + random comparison), total overhead <50ns per traced operation.

## Systems Architecture Optimizer

The cognitive tracing system creates interesting optimization opportunities around conditional compilation and feature flags:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "cognitive-tracing")]
macro_rules! trace_activation {
    ($tracer:expr, $trace_id:expr, $node:expr, $strength:expr) => {
        $tracer.record_activation($trace_id, $node, $strength)
    };
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "cognitive-tracing"))]
macro_rules! trace_activation {
    ($tracer:expr, $trace_id:expr, $node:expr, $strength:expr) => {
        // No-op in non-tracing builds
    };
}
```

This enables zero-overhead tracing in production builds where the feature is disabled. The compiler completely eliminates trace calls, ensuring no performance impact. For debug/analysis builds, full tracing is available with <5% overhead.

Memory layout optimization: trace events should be cache-line aligned and sized for efficient batch processing:

```rust
#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct TraceEventBatch {
    events: [TraceEvent; 8],  // 8 events fit in cache line
    count: u8,
    _padding: [u8; 7],
}
```

This ensures trace events can be processed in batches without false sharing, maximizing throughput during trace export and analysis.
