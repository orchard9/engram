# Cognitive Tracing Infrastructure: Twitter Thread

Distributed tracing shows you which microservice failed. Cognitive tracing shows you which activation cascade produced the wrong answer. Not HTTP requests - spreading activation paths. Not database queries - pattern completion decisions. Observability for thought itself.

Performance budget is brutal: spreading activation completes in 500-800us. Trace event recording must be <50ns or overhead exceeds 5%. Traditional logging adds milliseconds. Even fast structured logging adds 100-200ns. We need lock-free, zero-allocation event streams.

Architecture: SegQueue for lock-free event recording (15-20ns push), atomic sampling rate (5ns check), POD event types (32 bytes, cache-aligned). Total overhead 25-30ns per traced operation. With 10% sampling, overall impact <1%. Effectively free.

Conditional compilation eliminates all tracing code when feature disabled. Production builds pay zero overhead. Debug builds get full instrumentation with <5% impact. Macros expand to no-ops or actual trace calls based on compile-time feature flags.

Adaptive sampling: trace everything during anomalies (100% rate), sample during normal operation (1-10% rate). Atomic f32 sampling rate adjustable at runtime. Fast path is single atomic load plus random comparison - 5ns decision time.

Event types capture cognitive operations: NodeActivated, PatternCompleted, ConsolidationScheduled, ReconsolidationTriggered, InterferenceDetected. Each event has trace ID, timestamp (ns resolution), node, value (activation/confidence), packed metadata. Zero allocations.

Trace analysis identifies bottlenecks: gaps >100us between events indicate slow operations. Activation cascade analysis shows spreading coverage and strength distribution. Pattern completion analysis reveals partial match handling and confidence calibration.

Integration with spreading activation: wrap operations in start_trace/finish_trace, record events at critical points (node activation, pattern completion). Trace summary provides event count and duration. Foundation for Grafana dashboards visualizing cognitive patterns in real-time.
