# Comprehensive GPU vs CPU Benchmarking: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

fair comparison requires optimized CPU baseline

## Our Approach

compare against FAISS GPU and cuBLAS baselines

## Performance Results

RTX 3060: 7x, A100: 26x vs CPU

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses validated performance across consumer and datacenter GPUs.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
