# Twitter Thread: Comprehensive GPU vs CPU Benchmarking

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: fair comparison requires optimized CPU baseline

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
validated performance across consumer and datacenter GPUs requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
compare against FAISS GPU and cuBLAS baselines

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: RTX 3060: 7x, A100: 26x vs CPU

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
