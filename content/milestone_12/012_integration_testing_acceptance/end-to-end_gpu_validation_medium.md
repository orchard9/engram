# End-to-End GPU Validation: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

GPU resource isolation across concurrent memory spaces

## Our Approach

production workload stress testing with multi-tenancy

## Performance Results

10K+ operations/sec sustained under load

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses integration with Milestones 1-11 GPU acceleration.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
