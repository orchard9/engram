# Perspectives: Sparse Graph Operations on GPU

## GPU-Acceleration-Architect Perspective

CSR format and warp-level reduction for irregular graphs is the foundation for this implementation. The performance target of 5x speedup for graphs with 1K+ nodes, average degree 5 requires careful optimization of memory access patterns and warp-level cooperation.

## Systems-Architecture-Optimizer Perspective

The primary challenge is load balancing for irregular node degrees. This requires understanding the memory hierarchy and execution model at a deep level.

## Rust-Graph-Engine-Architect Perspective

Integration with Engram's existing architecture requires careful FFI design and error handling across the Rust-CUDA boundary.

## Verification-Testing-Lead Perspective

Validation requires differential testing, property-based edge case generation, and cross-architecture correctness verification.
