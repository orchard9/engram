# Twitter Thread: Sparse Graph Operations on GPU

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: load balancing for irregular node degrees

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
sparse matrix multiplication for graph activation spreading requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
CSR format and warp-level reduction for irregular graphs

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: 5x speedup for graphs with 1K+ nodes, average degree 5

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
