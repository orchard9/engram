# Research: Sparse Graph Operations on GPU

## Overview

This research examines sparse matrix multiplication for graph activation spreading for Engram's GPU acceleration in Milestone 12.

## Key Technical Concept

CSR format and warp-level reduction for irregular graphs

## Performance Target

5x speedup for graphs with 1K+ nodes, average degree 5

## Primary Challenge

load balancing for irregular node degrees

## Background

For detailed technical specifications, see roadmap/milestone-12/005_activation_spreading_kernel_pending.md and MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md.

## Conclusion

This component is critical for achieving production-ready GPU acceleration in Engram's cognitive memory system.
