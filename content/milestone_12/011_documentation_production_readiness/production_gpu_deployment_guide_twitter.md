# Twitter Thread: Production GPU Deployment Guide

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: document failure modes and recovery procedures

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
operational knowledge for GPU-enabled clusters requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
deployment architecture, monitoring, troubleshooting

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: enables external operators to deploy confidently

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
