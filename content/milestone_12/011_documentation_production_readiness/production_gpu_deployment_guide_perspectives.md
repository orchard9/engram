# Perspectives: Production GPU Deployment Guide

## GPU-Acceleration-Architect Perspective

deployment architecture, monitoring, troubleshooting is the foundation for this implementation. The performance target of enables external operators to deploy confidently requires careful optimization of memory access patterns and warp-level cooperation.

## Systems-Architecture-Optimizer Perspective

The primary challenge is document failure modes and recovery procedures. This requires understanding the memory hierarchy and execution model at a deep level.

## Rust-Graph-Engine-Architect Perspective

Integration with Engram's existing architecture requires careful FFI design and error handling across the Rust-CUDA boundary.

## Verification-Testing-Lead Perspective

Validation requires differential testing, property-based edge case generation, and cross-architecture correctness verification.
