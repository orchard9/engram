# Production GPU Deployment Guide: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

document failure modes and recovery procedures

## Our Approach

deployment architecture, monitoring, troubleshooting

## Performance Results

enables external operators to deploy confidently

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses operational knowledge for GPU-enabled clusters.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
