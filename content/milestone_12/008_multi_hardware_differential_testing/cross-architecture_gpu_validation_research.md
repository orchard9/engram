# Research: Cross-Architecture GPU Validation

## Overview

This research examines numerical stability across Maxwell, Pascal, Ampere, Hopper for Engram's GPU acceleration in Milestone 12.

## Key Technical Concept

differential testing with <1e-6 divergence tolerance

## Performance Target

validates correctness on 4+ GPU generations

## Primary Challenge

warp scheduler differences cause execution order variation

## Background

For detailed technical specifications, see roadmap/milestone-12/008_multi_hardware_differential_testing_pending.md and MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md.

## Conclusion

This component is critical for achieving production-ready GPU acceleration in Engram's cognitive memory system.
