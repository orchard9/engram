# Twitter Thread: Cross-Architecture GPU Validation

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: warp scheduler differences cause execution order variation

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
numerical stability across Maxwell, Pascal, Ampere, Hopper requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
differential testing with <1e-6 divergence tolerance

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: validates correctness on 4+ GPU generations

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
