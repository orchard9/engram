# Cross-Architecture GPU Validation: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

warp scheduler differences cause execution order variation

## Our Approach

differential testing with <1e-6 divergence tolerance

## Performance Results

validates correctness on 4+ GPU generations

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses numerical stability across Maxwell, Pascal, Ampere, Hopper.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
