# Perspectives: Intelligent CPU-GPU Dispatch

## GPU-Acceleration-Architect Perspective

decision tree using batch size, historical performance, GPU availability is the foundation for this implementation. The performance target of automatic fallback maintains 100% uptime requires careful optimization of memory access patterns and warp-level cooperation.

## Systems-Architecture-Optimizer Perspective

The primary challenge is dispatch overhead must be <1% of operation time. This requires understanding the memory hierarchy and execution model at a deep level.

## Rust-Graph-Engine-Architect Perspective

Integration with Engram's existing architecture requires careful FFI design and error handling across the Rust-CUDA boundary.

## Verification-Testing-Lead Perspective

Validation requires differential testing, property-based edge case generation, and cross-architecture correctness verification.
