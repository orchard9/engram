# Twitter Thread: Intelligent CPU-GPU Dispatch

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: dispatch overhead must be <1% of operation time

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
adaptive workload routing based on performance tracking requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
decision tree using batch size, historical performance, GPU availability

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: automatic fallback maintains 100% uptime

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
