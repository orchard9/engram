# Research: Intelligent CPU-GPU Dispatch

## Overview

This research examines adaptive workload routing based on performance tracking for Engram's GPU acceleration in Milestone 12.

## Key Technical Concept

decision tree using batch size, historical performance, GPU availability

## Performance Target

automatic fallback maintains 100% uptime

## Primary Challenge

dispatch overhead must be <1% of operation time

## Background

For detailed technical specifications, see roadmap/milestone-12/007_cpu_gpu_hybrid_executor_pending.md and MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md.

## Conclusion

This component is critical for achieving production-ready GPU acceleration in Engram's cognitive memory system.
