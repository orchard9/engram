# Intelligent CPU-GPU Dispatch: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

dispatch overhead must be <1% of operation time

## Our Approach

decision tree using batch size, historical performance, GPU availability

## Performance Results

automatic fallback maintains 100% uptime

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses adaptive workload routing based on performance tracking.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
