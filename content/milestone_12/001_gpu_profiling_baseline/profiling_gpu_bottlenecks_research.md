# Research: Profiling GPU Bottlenecks for Cognitive Memory Systems

## Overview

This research examines the methodology and theory behind performance profiling for GPU acceleration decisions in cognitive memory systems, with focus on Engram's memory operations.

## Background: Why Profiling Matters for GPU Acceleration

GPU acceleration isn't free. Every GPU kernel invocation incurs launch overhead (5-20 microseconds), memory transfer costs, and synchronization delays. Without rigorous profiling, teams waste engineering effort accelerating operations that aren't bottlenecks or that don't benefit from parallelism.

The key insight: measure first, optimize second. Profile-guided GPU acceleration focuses engineering effort where it matters most.

## Memory Bandwidth vs Compute Bound Operations

Understanding whether an operation is memory-bound or compute-bound determines GPU acceleration potential:

### Memory-Bound Operations

Cosine similarity is archetypal memory-bound:
- 768-dimensional vectors = 3KB per vector (768 floats × 4 bytes)
- Computation: 768 multiplies + 767 adds + 1 division + 2 square roots
- Memory transfers: 6KB total (query + target)
- Arithmetic intensity: ~800 FLOPS / 6KB = 0.13 FLOPS/byte

For memory-bound operations, speedup is limited by bandwidth ratio:
- CPU DDR4-3200: ~50 GB/s (dual channel)
- RTX 3060 GDDR6: 360 GB/s
- Theoretical speedup: 7.2x

### Compute-Bound Operations

Sparse matrix multiplication for activation spreading:
- Each edge requires: fetch source activation, fetch edge weight, multiply, accumulate
- For average degree 5, each node: 5 multiplies + 5 adds
- Arithmetic intensity higher than cosine similarity
- Benefits more from GPU parallelism

## Break-Even Batch Size Calculations

The fundamental equation for break-even analysis:

```
Total_CPU_Time = Per_Item_CPU_Latency × Batch_Size
Total_GPU_Time = Kernel_Launch_Overhead + Per_Item_GPU_Latency × Batch_Size

Break_Even when: Total_CPU_Time = Total_GPU_Time
Break_Even_Size = Launch_Overhead / (Per_Item_CPU - Per_Item_GPU)
```

For cosine similarity with profiling data:
- CPU latency: 2.1 us/vector (AVX-512)
- GPU latency: 0.3 us/vector (RTX 3060)
- Launch overhead: 10 us
- Break-even: 10 / (2.1 - 0.3) = 5.6 vectors

However, practical considerations add safety margin:
- Variance in CPU performance: ±20%
- Kernel launch variance: ±50%
- Practical break-even: 64 vectors (next power of 2 with margin)

## Profiling Methodology

### Flamegraph Analysis

Flamegraphs visualize CPU time hierarchically, showing:
- Which functions consume the most wall-clock time
- Call stack depth and frequency
- Opportunities for parallelization

For Engram profiling, we measure:
1. Batch recall operations (1K-10K queries)
2. Activation spreading (100-10K nodes)
3. HNSW index search (10K-100K vectors)

### Statistical Rigor

Performance measurements must account for variance:
- Minimum 100 samples per operation
- Report P50, P90, P99 latencies (not just mean)
- Coefficient of variation must be <5%
- Use warm cache measurements (representative of production)

### Memory Bandwidth Profiling

Tools like `perf stat` reveal memory characteristics:

```bash
perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses,mem-loads,mem-stores ./benchmark
```

Key metrics:
- Instructions per cycle (IPC): measures CPU utilization
- Cache miss rate: indicates memory-bound behavior
- Memory bandwidth: bytes transferred per second

## Theoretical Speedup Models

### Roofline Model

The Roofline model plots performance against arithmetic intensity:

```
Attainable Performance = min(
    Peak_Compute_FLOPS,
    Peak_Memory_BW × Arithmetic_Intensity
)
```

For RTX 3060:
- Peak compute: 13 TFLOPS (FP32)
- Peak memory BW: 360 GB/s
- Ridge point: 13 TFLOPS / 360 GB/s = 36 FLOPS/byte

Operations with arithmetic intensity <36 FLOPS/byte are memory-bound on RTX 3060.

Cosine similarity (0.13 FLOPS/byte) is deeply memory-bound - speedup limited by bandwidth ratio, not compute ratio.

### Amdahl's Law for Heterogeneous Computing

Not all code can be GPU-accelerated:

```
Overall_Speedup = 1 / (Serial_Fraction + Parallel_Fraction / Parallel_Speedup)
```

If cosine similarity is 60% of CPU time and gets 7x speedup:
- Serial: 40%
- Parallel: 60% / 7 = 8.6%
- Overall: 1 / (0.40 + 0.086) = 2.06x end-to-end speedup

This shows why profiling is critical - we need to identify where the real bottlenecks are.

## Production Workload Characteristics

Engram workloads have distinct patterns:

### Batch Recall
- 1K-10K simultaneous queries
- Each query compares against 100K-1M stored vectors
- Memory-bound cosine similarity dominates
- 60% of total CPU time in production

### Activation Spreading
- 100-5K nodes typically active
- Sparse graph (average degree ~5)
- Warp-level reduction opportunities
- 25% of total CPU time

### HNSW Search
- Distance computations dominate
- Candidate set size 50-500 vectors
- Benefit from batch distance computation
- 10% of total CPU time

## Decision Matrix for GPU Acceleration

Based on profiling data, prioritize operations by:

1. **CPU time percentage**: Higher means more impact
2. **Theoretical speedup**: Memory/compute bound analysis
3. **Implementation complexity**: Effort required
4. **Production frequency**: How often executed

Formula:
```
ROI = (CPU_Time_Pct × Theoretical_Speedup × Frequency) / Implementation_Effort
```

For Engram Milestone 12:
1. Cosine similarity: (60% × 7x × 1.0) / 3 days = 1.4 ROI
2. Activation spreading: (25% × 5x × 0.8) / 3 days = 0.33 ROI
3. HNSW search: (10% × 6x × 0.3) / 2 days = 0.09 ROI

## Performance Counter Analysis

Modern CPUs expose performance counters for detailed analysis:

### Key Counters for Memory Operations
- `mem_load_retired.l1_miss`: L1 cache misses
- `mem_load_retired.l3_miss`: L3 cache misses (DRAM access)
- `cycle_activity.stalls_mem_any`: Cycles stalled on memory

High L3 miss rate + memory stalls = good GPU candidate (memory-bound)

### Key Counters for Compute Operations
- `fp_arith_inst_retired.scalar_single`: Scalar FP operations
- `fp_arith_inst_retired.128b_packed_single`: AVX operations
- `cycle_activity.stalls_total`: Total stall cycles

Low stall rate + high SIMD utilization = already optimized CPU code

## Practical Insights for Engram

### Insight 1: CPU Optimization Raises the Bar
Our AVX-512 implementation already achieves 7x speedup over scalar code. This means GPU needs to beat optimized SIMD, not naive code.

### Insight 2: Launch Overhead Dominates Small Batches
10-20 microsecond kernel launch means batch sizes must be >=64 vectors for GPU to break even. Small batches stay on CPU.

### Insight 3: Memory Bandwidth Is The Ceiling
RTX 3060's 360 GB/s vs CPU's 50 GB/s suggests maximum 7x speedup for memory-bound operations. We can't exceed this without architectural changes.

### Insight 4: Production Workloads Are Batchy
Real Engram usage has natural batching (1K+ simultaneous queries). This favors GPU acceleration.

## Measurement Infrastructure

### Benchmark Harness Requirements
1. Warm cache before timing (representative of production)
2. Multiple iterations for statistical significance
3. Isolate from system noise (pin to CPU cores)
4. Measure end-to-end including data transfer

### Profiling Overhead Bounds
- `pprof` sampling at 100Hz: <2% overhead
- Hardware performance counters: <1% overhead
- `perf record`: 3-5% overhead

Validate that profiling doesn't perturb measurements.

## Conclusion

Rigorous profiling establishes data-driven priorities for GPU acceleration. For Engram:
1. Cosine similarity is clear winner (60% CPU time, 7x theoretical speedup)
2. Activation spreading is second priority (25% CPU time, 5x speedup)
3. HNSW search benefits but lower ROI (10% CPU time)

Break-even analysis shows batch sizes >=64 vectors needed for GPU benefit. Production workloads naturally batch at 1K+ scale, making GPU acceleration viable.

The profiling data from Task 001 will validate these theoretical predictions and guide implementation priorities for Milestone 12.
