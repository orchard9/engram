# Twitter Thread: Profiling for GPU Acceleration

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Before writing a single GPU kernel, we profiled Engram's memory operations. The results were shocking: 60% of CPU time spent on ONE operation - cosine similarity.

This is why profiling matters more than optimization.

Thread on data-driven GPU acceleration:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
The GPU acceleration trap: teams spend weeks implementing CUDA kernels for operations that contribute <5% to runtime.

Or worse - operations already faster on CPU due to 10us kernel launch overhead.

Profiling separates high-impact work from busy-work.

## Tweet 3 (Break-Even Math)
Every GPU kernel invocation costs 10us in launch overhead.

For cosine similarity:
- CPU: 2.1us/vector (AVX-512)
- GPU: 0.3us/vector (RTX 3060)
- Break-even: 10us / 1.8us = 6 vectors

Practical minimum with safety margin: 64 vectors

Small batches stay on CPU.

## Tweet 4 (Memory Bandwidth Physics)
Cosine similarity is memory-bound, not compute-bound.

RTX 3060: 360 GB/s bandwidth
CPU DDR4: 50 GB/s bandwidth
Theoretical max speedup: 7.2x

You can't beat the physics. Memory bandwidth is your ceiling.

## Tweet 5 (The Roofline Model)
The Roofline model keeps you honest.

RTX 3060 ridge point: 36 FLOPS/byte
Cosine similarity: 0.13 FLOPS/byte

We're deeply memory-bound. No amount of kernel optimization exceeds the 7x bandwidth ratio.

Claims of "100x GPU speedup" ignore physics.

## Tweet 6 (Decision Matrix)
Our profiling-driven prioritization:

Cosine similarity: 60% CPU time × 7x speedup = IMPLEMENT NOW
Activation spreading: 25% CPU time × 5x speedup = second priority
HNSW search: 10% CPU time × 6x speedup = third priority

ROI calculation drives engineering effort.

## Tweet 7 (Amdahl's Law Reality)
Even with 7x speedup on cosine similarity (60% of runtime):

Overall speedup = 1 / (0.40 + 0.60/7) = 2.06x end-to-end

This is why you profile the ENTIRE system, not just one operation.

Serial portions constrain overall performance.

## Tweet 8 (Call to Action)
The profiling workflow for GPU acceleration:

1. Flamegraph - find hot functions
2. Perf counters - memory vs compute bound
3. Roofline model - theoretical ceiling
4. Break-even analysis - when GPU wins
5. ROI calculation - prioritize effort

Profile first. Optimize second.
