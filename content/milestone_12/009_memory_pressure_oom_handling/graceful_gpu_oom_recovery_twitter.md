# Twitter Thread: Graceful GPU OOM Recovery

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: detecting OOM before kernel launch failure

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
adaptive batch sizing and CPU fallback under memory pressure requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
exponential backoff for batch size, automatic CPU migration

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: zero crashes from OOM, graceful degradation

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
