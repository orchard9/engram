# Perspectives: Graceful GPU OOM Recovery

## GPU-Acceleration-Architect Perspective

exponential backoff for batch size, automatic CPU migration is the foundation for this implementation. The performance target of zero crashes from OOM, graceful degradation requires careful optimization of memory access patterns and warp-level cooperation.

## Systems-Architecture-Optimizer Perspective

The primary challenge is detecting OOM before kernel launch failure. This requires understanding the memory hierarchy and execution model at a deep level.

## Rust-Graph-Engine-Architect Perspective

Integration with Engram's existing architecture requires careful FFI design and error handling across the Rust-CUDA boundary.

## Verification-Testing-Lead Perspective

Validation requires differential testing, property-based edge case generation, and cross-architecture correctness verification.
