# Research: Graceful GPU OOM Recovery

## Overview

This research examines adaptive batch sizing and CPU fallback under memory pressure for Engram's GPU acceleration in Milestone 12.

## Key Technical Concept

exponential backoff for batch size, automatic CPU migration

## Performance Target

zero crashes from OOM, graceful degradation

## Primary Challenge

detecting OOM before kernel launch failure

## Background

For detailed technical specifications, see roadmap/milestone-12/009_memory_pressure_oom_handling_pending.md and MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md.

## Conclusion

This component is critical for achieving production-ready GPU acceleration in Engram's cognitive memory system.
