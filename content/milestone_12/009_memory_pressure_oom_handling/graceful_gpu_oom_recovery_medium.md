# Graceful GPU OOM Recovery: Production GPU Acceleration

## The Challenge

detecting OOM before kernel launch failure

## Our Approach

exponential backoff for batch size, automatic CPU migration

## Performance Results

zero crashes from OOM, graceful degradation

## Implementation Details

For Engram's Milestone 12, this component addresses adaptive batch sizing and CPU fallback under memory pressure.

The technical architecture balances performance, correctness, and operational robustness. Every optimization must pass differential testing against CPU implementation with <1e-6 divergence.

## Conclusion

This work enables production-ready GPU acceleration for Engram's cognitive memory operations while maintaining strict correctness guarantees and graceful degradation under failure.
