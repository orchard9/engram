# Research: Batch Distance Computation for HNSW

## Overview

This research examines warp-level top-k selection for vector index search for Engram's GPU acceleration in Milestone 12.

## Key Technical Concept

parallel distance computation with bitonic sort for top-k

## Performance Target

6x speedup for candidate sets of 100+ vectors

## Primary Challenge

maintaining sorted order across warp threads

## Background

For detailed technical specifications, see roadmap/milestone-12/006_hnsw_candidate_scoring_kernel_pending.md and MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md.

## Conclusion

This component is critical for achieving production-ready GPU acceleration in Engram's cognitive memory system.
