# Twitter Thread: Batch Distance Computation for HNSW

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Building production GPU acceleration for cognitive AI systems.

Challenge: maintaining sorted order across warp threads

Thread on our solution:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
warp-level top-k selection for vector index search requires careful optimization for GPU architecture.

## Tweet 3 (Key Insight)
parallel distance computation with bitonic sort for top-k

## Tweet 4 (Performance)
Results: 6x speedup for candidate sets of 100+ vectors

## Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Production GPU systems require:
- Correctness via differential testing
- Performance via architecture-aware optimization  
- Robustness via graceful degradation
