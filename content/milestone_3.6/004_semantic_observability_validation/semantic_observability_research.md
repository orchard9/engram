# Semantic Recall Observability & Validation Research

## Research Topics

### 1. Semantic Evaluation Methodologies

#### Information Retrieval Metrics
- **nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Ranking-aware metric that considers position of relevant results
  - Standard in multilingual IR systems (Järvelin & Kekäläinen, 2002)
  - Accounts for graded relevance, not just binary match/no-match
  - Formula: nDCG@k = DCG@k / IDCG@k where DCG weights by log position

- **Recall@k and Precision@k**: Traditional metrics for top-k retrieval
  - Recall: what fraction of relevant items appear in top k results
  - Precision: what fraction of top k results are relevant
  - MAP (Mean Average Precision): averages precision across recall levels

- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Focus on first relevant result position
  - Critical for question-answering and conversational systems
  - Formula: 1/rank of first relevant result, averaged across queries

#### Cross-Lingual Evaluation Challenges
- **CLEF (Cross-Language Evaluation Forum)**: Established benchmarks for multilingual IR
  - CLEF datasets cover 20+ languages with query-document pairs
  - Emphasizes evaluation across language families (Romance, Germanic, Slavic, Asian)

- **MIRACL (Multilingual Information Retrieval Across a Continuum of Languages)**: Recent benchmark
  - 18 languages including low-resource (Bengali, Swahili, Yoruba)
  - Wikipedia-based corpus with human-annotated relevance judgments
  - Published findings: embedding-based retrieval struggles with morphologically rich languages

- **XTREME (Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders)**: Broad NLU evaluation
  - Includes MLQA (multilingual question answering) useful for semantic recall validation
  - Covers 40+ languages with typologically diverse test sets

#### Semantic Expansion Evaluation
- **Query Performance Prediction (QPP)**: Metrics to predict expansion quality
  - Clarity score: KL divergence between query and collection language models
  - Pre-retrieval predictors vs post-retrieval (require knowing results)

- **Expansion Effectiveness Metrics**:
  - Delta nDCG: change in ranking quality with vs without expansion
  - Coverage ratio: fraction of results coming from expanded terms vs original
  - Semantic drift: cosine similarity between original query embedding and expanded result centroids

#### Figurative Language Benchmarks
- **FLUE (Figurative Language Understanding Evaluation)**: Benchmark for metaphor, idiom, sarcasm detection
  - Includes literal vs figurative disambiguation tasks
  - Tests model ability to retrieve semantically related but lexically distant content

- **MAGPIE (Metaphor and sarcAsm Generation, Paraphrase and Idiom Evaluation)**: Dataset for figurative language
  - 1.8M examples covering idioms, metaphors, similes
  - Multilingual coverage (English, Chinese, Spanish)

### 2. Observability Patterns for Retrieval Systems

#### Metrics Architecture
- **RED Method** (Rate, Errors, Duration) for request-oriented systems
  - Rate: queries per second, expansion invocations per second
  - Errors: failed embeddings, timeout on semantic router
  - Duration: p50/p95/p99 latency for query expansion, embedding generation

- **USE Method** (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) for resource-oriented monitoring
  - Utilization: embedding model GPU usage, cache hit rates
  - Saturation: queue depth for batch embedding requests
  - Errors: OOM events, model loading failures

#### Semantic-Specific Metrics
- **Confidence calibration metrics**:
  - Expected Calibration Error (ECE): average gap between predicted confidence and actual accuracy
  - Reliability diagrams: plot predicted vs observed correctness across confidence bins
  - Brier score: MSE between predicted probabilities and binary outcomes

- **Expansion quality indicators**:
  - Expansion breadth: average number of synonyms/variants added per query term
  - Semantic coherence: average cosine similarity among expanded terms
  - Novelty ratio: fraction of expanded results not in original query results

#### Streaming Diagnostics
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events) payload design**:
  - Progressive disclosure: send match count, then top results, then diagnostics
  - Structured events: separate event types for results, metrics, debug info
  - Backward compatibility: version field, optional diagnostic blocks

- **Real-time quality signals**:
  - Per-query expansion decisions (literal vs expanded path taken)
  - Embedding cache hit/miss for performance debugging
  - Confidence distribution across returned results

### 3. Regression Detection Strategies

#### Statistical Process Control
- **CUSUM (Cumulative Sum Control Chart)**: Detect small shifts in mean performance
  - More sensitive than fixed thresholds to gradual degradation
  - Used in production ML monitoring (Netflix, Google)

- **EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average)**: Time-weighted quality tracking
  - Recent queries matter more than historical baseline
  - Parameterize lambda to balance responsiveness vs stability

#### Benchmark Stability Techniques
- **Deterministic evaluation**:
  - Fix random seeds for reproducible ANN searches
  - Pin dataset versions with content hashing
  - Control for CPU frequency scaling, cache warming

- **Variance analysis**:
  - Run each benchmark N times, report confidence intervals
  - Identify high-variance queries that need separate treatment
  - Use bootstrap resampling to estimate metric distribution

#### CI/CD Integration Patterns
- **Nightly regression suites**: Full benchmark sweep on main branch
  - Store results in time-series database (Prometheus, InfluxDB)
  - Alert on statistically significant drops (t-test, Mann-Whitney U)

- **PR-level smoke tests**: Subset evaluation on feature branches
  - Fast feedback loop (5-10 min) on representative queries
  - Block merge if core scenarios regress beyond tolerance

### 4. Operator Experience Design

#### Dashboard Design Principles
- **Hierarchical detail**: Overview panel, drill-down into languages/query types
  - Top: aggregate nDCG, QPS, p95 latency
  - Middle: per-language breakdown, expansion vs literal split
  - Bottom: individual query traces with semantic diagnostics

- **Actionable visualizations**:
  - Heatmaps: nDCG across language pairs (source query lang x result doc lang)
  - Time series: trend lines with anomaly highlighting
  - Histograms: confidence distributions, latency percentiles

#### Alert Design
- **Tiered severity**:
  - P0: >10% drop in nDCG, embedding service down
  - P1: >5% drop, >2x latency increase
  - P2: Elevated error rates, cache eviction spikes

- **Runbook integration**:
  - Each alert links to specific troubleshooting doc
  - Include recent related alerts (correlated failures)
  - Suggested mitigation steps with rollback procedures

#### Log Structured Events
- **Semantic event schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-11T14:32:01Z",
    "event_type": "semantic_query",
    "query_id": "uuid",
    "original_text": "...",
    "detected_language": "es",
    "expansion_applied": true,
    "expansion_terms": ["synonym1", "synonym2"],
    "figurative_detected": false,
    "top_results": [{"id": "...", "confidence": 0.87}],
    "metrics": {
      "expansion_latency_ms": 12,
      "embedding_latency_ms": 45,
      "total_latency_ms": 234
    }
  }
  ```
- Enables correlation analysis, A/B testing, debugging specific query failures

### 5. Privacy & Legal Considerations

#### Dataset Licensing
- **Benchmark corpus sourcing**:
  - Prefer CC-BY or CC0 licensed datasets (Wikipedia, Common Crawl)
  - Avoid user-generated content without explicit consent
  - Document provenance for all evaluation examples

- **Anonymization requirements**:
  - Strip PII from logged queries before archival
  - Aggregate metrics at population level for dashboards
  - Implement data retention policies (GDPR, CCPA compliance)

#### Bias and Fairness Auditing
- **Cross-lingual performance disparity**:
  - Track nDCG gap between high-resource (English) and low-resource languages
  - Set fairness thresholds: no language should underperform by >15% relative to English

- **Representation in benchmarks**:
  - Ensure test queries cover diverse domains (technical, conversational, literary)
  - Include queries from multiple demographic groups to detect skew
