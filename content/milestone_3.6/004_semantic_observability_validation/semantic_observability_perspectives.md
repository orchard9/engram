# Semantic Recall Observability: Architectural Perspectives

## 1. Cognitive Architecture Perspective

### The Challenge: Evaluating Human-Like Memory Recall

Semantic recall observability is fundamentally about measuring whether a computational memory system behaves like human episodic and semantic memory. Traditional IR metrics (precision, recall) treat all results as equivalent, but cognitive systems must:

1. **Distinguish retrieval modes**: Literal pattern matching vs semantic association vs metaphorical reasoning
2. **Handle graded relevance**: Human memory doesn't return binary matches but activations with varying confidence
3. **Support cross-linguistic transfer**: Multilinguals retrieve concepts regardless of encoding language

### Key Insight: Metrics Must Reflect Cognitive Processes

The proposed nDCG@k metric aligns well with activation spreading in associative memory:
- Position-weighted scoring mirrors decaying activation strength
- Graded relevance captures probabilistic retrieval (not all-or-nothing)
- Top-k focus matches working memory capacity constraints (Miller's 7Â±2 items)

However, we need cognitive-specific extensions:

**Schema Activation Metrics**:
- Measure whether figurative queries activate appropriate semantic frames
- Example: "debugging" query should activate both literal code errors AND metaphorical troubleshooting schemas
- Track cross-schema interference (when literal interpretation blocks figurative understanding)

**Temporal Dynamics**:
- Human recall quality degrades with interference and time
- Benchmarks should include queries at different temporal distances from memory encoding
- Measure: Does semantic expansion compensate for time-based decay?

**Consolidation Quality**:
- Semantic memories emerge from episodic consolidation
- Validate that frequently co-activated concepts develop stronger semantic links
- Metric: Growth rate of semantic association strength over repeated queries

### Implementation Considerations

**Biologically-Inspired Regression Detection**:
- Use drift thresholds analogous to synaptic plasticity ranges (5-15% acceptable variance)
- Mirror hippocampal indexing: quick detection of catastrophic failures, slower adaptation to gradual drift
- Alert severity should match cognitive urgency (immediate threats vs background learning)

**Operator Dashboards as Metacognition**:
- Dashboards provide "metacognitive awareness" of system performance
- Structure information hierarchically like human meta-memory: quick judgments (fluency) before detailed retrieval
- Use confidence calibration to help operators trust or question system behavior

## 2. Memory Systems Perspective

### The Challenge: Validating Complementary Learning Systems

Engram's semantic recall validation must ensure coordination between fast episodic encoding and slow semantic consolidation, mirroring the hippocampal-neocortical dialogue in the brain.

### Key Insight: Separate Evaluation for Complementary Subsystems

**Episodic Recall Metrics**:
- Pattern completion accuracy: Can the system reconstruct full episodes from partial cues?
- Specificity: Does retrieval distinguish similar episodes (reduce interference)?
- Recency effects: Recent memories should have higher activation

**Semantic Recall Metrics**:
- Generalization: Do semantic queries activate appropriate episodic exemplars?
- Abstraction quality: Measure semantic prototype coherence across languages
- Cross-modal transfer: Query in one language, retrieve from another

**Consolidation Validation**:
- Track semantic link formation over simulated "sleep" cycles
- Measure: Do high-frequency co-occurrences become semantic associations?
- Regression test: Does consolidation preserve episodic distinctiveness while building semantic structure?

### Implementation Considerations

**Evaluation Corpus Design**:
- Create synthetic "life histories" with repeated concepts across episodes
- Annotate expected semantic clusters that should emerge post-consolidation
- Include interference scenarios (similar episodes that should remain distinct)

**Streaming Metrics for Memory Dynamics**:
- SSE events should expose episodic vs semantic path taken for each query
- Track activation spreading depth (how far from initial query point)
- Report memory pressure (when episodic cache evicts to make room)

**Regression Thresholds Based on Forgetting Curves**:
- Acceptable degradation follows Ebbinghaus curves (rapid early forgetting, then plateau)
- Alert if semantic recall drops faster than predicted by spacing effect
- Distinguish normal forgetting from catastrophic interference

## 3. Rust Graph Engine Perspective

### The Challenge: High-Performance Semantic Search with Observable Internals

Semantic recall requires complex graph traversals (spreading activation, HNSW navigation, cross-lingual routing) that are traditionally black boxes. Observability must expose low-level graph operations without sacrificing performance.

### Key Insight: Zero-Cost Observability Through Compile-Time Instrumentation

Rust's type system and compiler optimizations enable metrics collection with minimal runtime overhead:

**Feature-Gated Metrics**:
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "detailed-metrics")]
struct ActivationMetrics {
    nodes_visited: AtomicU64,
    edges_traversed: AtomicU64,
    cache_hits: AtomicU64,
}
```
- Production builds use feature flags to include/exclude instrumentation
- Lock-free atomics for concurrent metric updates (no contention bottlenecks)
- SIMD-optimized batch updates when measuring spreading activation

**Type-State Pattern for Query Routing**:
```rust
struct Query<State> { ... }
impl Query<Literal> { ... }
impl Query<Expanded> { ... }
```
- Type system enforces correct semantic routing decisions
- Each transition (literal -> expanded -> figurative) logged at zero runtime cost
- Compiler inlines metrics code, eliminates dynamic dispatch

**Const Generics for Benchmark Parameterization**:
```rust
fn benchmark_recall<const K: usize, const LANGS: usize>() { ... }
```
- Generate specialized code for different k values and language counts
- Enables exact performance regression detection (no variance from polymorphism)
- Criterion integration with const-generic test matrix

### Implementation Considerations

**HNSW Instrumentation**:
- Track layers visited, distance computations per query
- Measure graph connectivity health (broken links, isolated components)
- Alert on pathological searches (excessive backtracking, layer imbalance)

**Embedding Pipeline Metrics**:
- GPU utilization for batch embedding generation
- Cache hit rates for repeated queries (Bloom filter pre-checks)
- Cross-lingual embedding alignment quality (cosine similarity between translation pairs)

**Lock-Free Metrics Aggregation**:
- Use crossbeam channels for batched metric collection
- Avoid per-query allocations with object pools
- SPSC queues for SSE event streaming (single producer per connection)

## 4. Systems Architecture Perspective

### The Challenge: Multi-Tier Semantic Search with Bounded Latency

Semantic recall spans multiple storage tiers (hot SSD, warm HDD, cold object store) and compute resources (CPU for routing, GPU for embeddings, specialized vector indices). Observability must track cross-tier performance and identify bottlenecks.

### Key Insight: Distributed Tracing with Semantic Context

Standard distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) lacks semantic-specific spans. Extend tracing to include:

**Semantic Span Attributes**:
- `semantic.query.language`: detected query language
- `semantic.expansion.applied`: boolean flag
- `semantic.figurative.detected`: metaphor/idiom classification
- `semantic.tier.hits`: which storage tiers contributed results
- `semantic.confidence.p95`: 95th percentile confidence of returned results

**Tier-Aware Latency Budgets**:
- Hot tier: <10ms (HNSW search in RAM)
- Warm tier: <100ms (SSD-backed vector index)
- Cold tier: <1s (S3 fetch + embedding re-computation)
- Set tier-specific p95/p99 SLOs, alert on violations

**Cross-Tier Semantic Coherence**:
- Measure: Do results from different tiers cluster semantically?
- Detect tier skew (e.g., cold tier returns lower-quality matches)
- Optimize tiering policy based on semantic access patterns

### Implementation Considerations

**NUMA-Aware Benchmark Execution**:
- Pin evaluation harness to specific CPU cores (avoid cache thrashing)
- Use `numactl` to control memory allocation locality
- Measure variance across NUMA nodes to ensure fair comparisons

**Tiered Metrics Storage**:
- Real-time metrics: in-memory ring buffers (last 1 hour, 1-second granularity)
- Medium-term: compressed SSE logs (last 7 days, 1-minute rollups)
- Long-term: object store (monthly aggregates for trend analysis)

**Grafana Dashboard Architecture**:
- Top panel: RED metrics aggregated across all tiers
- Middle: per-tier breakdown with tier-crossing flow diagram (Sankey chart)
- Bottom: query trace viewer with semantic annotations

**Alert Correlation Engine**:
- Cluster related alerts (e.g., GPU saturation + embedding latency spike)
- Suppress transient anomalies (single-query outliers)
- Escalate persistent degradation (>3 consecutive intervals below threshold)

## 5. Verification & Testing Perspective

### The Challenge: Ensuring Semantic Correctness Under Distribution Shift

Semantic models (embedding networks, multilingual routers) are vulnerable to drift as language usage evolves. Regression detection must catch both statistical degradation and semantic correctness failures.

### Key Insight: Differential Testing Between Semantic Strategies

**Baseline Comparisons**:
- Literal-only search as reference implementation (deterministic, well-understood)
- Measure: Does semantic expansion improve nDCG compared to baseline?
- Regression: Flag if expansion underperforms literal on any language

**Cross-Model Validation**:
- Run same queries through multiple embedding models (e.g., multilingual-e5, LaBSE)
- Compare result set overlap (Jaccard similarity)
- Alert if models diverge significantly (indicates dataset shift or model degradation)

**Property-Based Semantic Testing**:
- **Symmetry**: If query A retrieves doc B, query B should retrieve doc A (modulo decay)
- **Transitivity (weak)**: If A->B and B->C highly confident, A->C should exist
- **Language invariance**: Translating query should not drastically change result distribution

### Implementation Considerations

**Fuzzing Semantic Routers**:
- Generate adversarial queries (code-switched, misspelled, ambiguous)
- Ensure graceful degradation (no panics, bounded latency)
- Measure: Does confidence calibration reflect actual correctness under noise?

**Deterministic Reproducibility**:
- Fix random seeds for HNSW construction, embedding model inference
- Use snapshot testing for expected top-10 results on canonical queries
- Version-control benchmark datasets with content hashing (detect silent corruption)

**Statistical Significance Testing**:
- Use paired t-tests when comparing nDCG before/after changes
- Report effect sizes (Cohen's d), not just p-values
- Set minimum detectable effect (e.g., 0.02 nDCG change) to avoid chasing noise

**Formal Verification Opportunities**:
- Prove embedding cache eviction preserves semantic coverage (no dead zones)
- Verify tier migration logic maintains k-NN guarantees
- Use SMT solvers to check query expansion rules don't introduce contradictions

**Rationale**: The systems architecture perspective offers the most actionable content for practitioners building production ML systems. It bridges theoretical evaluation (nDCG, calibration) with operational reality (multi-tier storage, bounded latency, NUMA awareness). This angle will resonate with SRE and MLOps audiences who need concrete patterns for shipping semantic search.
