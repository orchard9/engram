# Twitter Thread: Zero-Copy Figurative Language Processing in Rust

## Thread

1/12

Your memory system handles billions of episodes, has <50ms p95 latency, uses lock-free HNSW for similarity search.

But when users ask "When did Sarah give me the cold shoulder?" it returns nothing.

Why? Because the memory says "Sarah ignored me."

Thread on fixing this.

The problem: human communication is fundamentally metaphorical.

"Cold shoulder" = ignored
"Break the ice" = start conversation
"Time flies" = passes quickly

Cognitive linguistics (Lakoff & Johnson) shows we structure abstract concepts through concrete metaphors.

Literal-only systems will never feel natural.

The naive fix: throw an LLM at every query.

Cost: +50-200ms latency
Result: p95 goes from 40ms to 90ms+

Users notice. Competitors win.

We need figurative processing that adds <10ms overhead while working across languages and providing explainable results.

Solution: two-stage detection

Stage 1 (fast path):
- Rule-based for explicit markers: "like a", "as X as"
- Hash table lookup for common idioms
- Uses &'static data, SIMD string search
- Latency: <2ms

Stage 2 (semantic):
- Embedding similarity for implicit metaphors
- Latency: <3ms

Key insight: use lock-free concurrent data structures

```rust
pub struct FigurativeMapper {
    idiom_map: Arc<DashMap<CompactString, Vec<LiteralInterpretation>>>,
    concept_index: Arc<HnswIndex>,
}
```

DashMap enables concurrent reads without locks
Multiple query threads proceed without contention

Zero-copy design principles:

1. Store patterns as &'static - no heap allocations
2. Use CompactString - short strings stay on stack
3. Static rationales - "idiom: cold shoulder -> ignore" known at compile time
4. Arc sharing - eliminates cloning overhead

Result: entire hot path stays in L1/L2 cache

Integration with spreading activation via lazy iterators:

```rust
pub fn merged_cues(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = WeightedCue> + '_ {
    literal.chain(figurative.filter(|c| c.confidence >= 0.7))
}
```

No materialized vectors
Confidence filtering happens inline
Zero-copy chaining

Amortized annotation: shift cost to write path

During ingestion:
- Detect figurative language once
- Store annotations with episode metadata
- Persist to memory-mapped storage

During queries:
- Just read precomputed annotations
- Detection cost paid once, used many times

Multilingual support via language-specific pipelines:

English: "cold shoulder" -> "ignore"
Chinese: "chi bi geng" -> "reject"

Fallback to English rules for unsupported languages
Graceful degradation beats hard requirements

Explainability is non-negotiable:

```json
{
  "explanation": {
    "type": "figurative_match",
    "figurative_form": "cold shoulder",
    "literal_interpretation": "ignored",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "rationale": "idiom: English lexicon"
  }
}
```

Operators need transparency
Users deserve to understand matches

Performance results on 10K query benchmark:

Baseline: p95 38ms
With figurative: p95 42ms (+4ms, 10% overhead)

Breakdown:
- Rule detection: 1.8ms
- Idiom lookup: 0.9ms
- Embedding similarity: 2.1ms
- Cue merging: 0.3ms

Total: ~5ms p95

Key lessons for systems engineers:

1. Zero-copy designs eliminate allocation overhead
2. Lock-free structures (DashMap) prevent contention
3. Amortize expensive ops to write path
4. Lazy evaluation reduces waste
5. Explainability from day one
6. Graceful degradation over hard requirements

Human cognition is metaphorical. Our systems must be too.
