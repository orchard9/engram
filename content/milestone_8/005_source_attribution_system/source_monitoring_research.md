# Source Attribution System: Research Foundations

## Source Monitoring Framework

### Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay (1993)
Source Monitoring Framework: How people attribute memories to sources.

**Three Types:**
1. **External Source Monitoring:** Which external source provided information (person A vs person B)
2. **Internal Source Monitoring:** Did I imagine this or actually experience it?
3. **Reality Monitoring:** Perceived vs imagined memories

**Critical Finding:** People struggle to distinguish sources, especially when:
- Time delay increases
- Source information not explicitly encoded
- Suggested information is plausible

**Engram Application:** Explicit source tracking is essential. Confidence alone doesn't indicate source.

### Lindsay & Johnson (2000): Reality Monitoring Failures
Key experiments showing false memory formation:
- Imagined events become "recalled" memories
- Suggested details incorporated into genuine memories
- High confidence doesn't predict source accuracy

**Solution:** Independent source attribution metadata. Don't rely on confidence to distinguish recalled vs reconstructed.

## Source Attribution Based on Evidence Pathways

### Direct Recall Pathway
Field present in partial cue → came from user's query → Recalled source

Confidence = cue_strength (how complete was the partial episode)

### Reconstruction Pathway
Field completed from temporal neighbors → inferred from context → Reconstructed source

Confidence = consensus among neighbors (agreement ratio)

### Consolidation Pathway
Field derived from semantic patterns → statistical regularities → Consolidated source

Confidence = pattern strength (p-value)

### Imagination Pathway
Field speculated with low confidence → insufficient evidence → Imagined source

Confidence <0.3

## Alternative Hypotheses: Preventing Confabulation

### Koriat & Goldsmith (1996): Metacognitive Monitoring
People generate multiple alternative answers and choose based on metacognitive confidence.

**Regulation:** Output can be withheld if confidence doesn't meet threshold.

**Engram Application:** Generate multiple completion hypotheses using different pattern weights. User sees alternatives, preventing single-path confabulation.

### System 2 Reasoning (Kahneman 2011)
Fast System 1: Pattern completion (CA3 dynamics)
Slow System 2: Deliberative reasoning and checking

**Alternative Hypotheses:** System 2 reviews System 1 completions, generates alternatives by varying parameters.
