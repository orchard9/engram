# Accuracy Validation & Production Tuning: Research Foundations

## Ground Truth Validation Methodologies

### Deliberate Corruption Testing
Gold standard for evaluating reconstruction: Start with complete episode, deliberately corrupt, attempt reconstruction, measure accuracy.

**Corruption Levels:**
- 30% corruption: Mild (similar to partial recall)
- 50% corruption: Moderate (fragmentary memory)
- 70% corruption: Severe (sparse cues only)

**Target Accuracy:**
Human memory performance on similar tasks:
- 30% corruption: 80-90% reconstruction (Bartlett, 1932)
- 50% corruption: 60-75% reconstruction
- 70% corruption: 40-55% reconstruction

Engram target: Match or exceed human performance.

### DRM Paradigm (Deese-Roediger-McDermott)

**Classic False Memory Test:**
1. Present semantically related words (bed, rest, awake, tired, dream, wake, night)
2. Critical lure "sleep" never presented
3. Test recall: Subjects falsely "remember" sleep with high confidence

**Roediger & McDermott (1995):** False memory rate ~65% for critical lures.

**Application to Engram:**
- Store semantically related episodes (breakfast: coffee, eggs, toast, orange juice)
- Test completion with partial cue
- Measure false reconstruction rate for plausible but absent details (bacon)
- Target: <15% false reconstructions at high confidence (better than humans)

## Serial Position Curves

### Primacy and Recency Effects (Murdock, 1962)

**Free Recall Performance:**
- Primacy effect: First items recalled better (~70% accuracy)
- Middle items: Poorest recall (~40% accuracy)
- Recency effect: Last items recalled best (~80% accuracy)

**Explanation:**
- Primacy: Consolidated to long-term memory
- Recency: Still in working memory
- Middle: Interference from both directions

**Engram Validation:**
Present temporal sequence of episodes (1-20 items). Test completion for each position. Should show:
- Primacy effect >5% accuracy boost (consolidated patterns strong)
- Recency effect >10% accuracy boost (temporal context strong)
- U-shaped curve matching human data

## Parameter Tuning via Grid Search

### Multi-Dimensional Parameter Space

**Critical Parameters:**
1. CA3 sparsity (default 0.05): Controls attractor sharpness
2. CA1 threshold (default 0.7): Precision/recall tradeoff
3. Pattern weight (default 0.4): Local vs global balance
4. Num hypotheses (default 3): Coverage vs latency

**Grid Search:**
```
for sparsity in [0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10]:
  for threshold in [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]:
    for pattern_weight in [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6]:
      for num_hypotheses in [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]:
        run_validation_suite()
        record_accuracy_latency()
```

Total: 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625 configurations.

**Optimization:** Prune obviously bad configurations early. Use Bayesian optimization after initial grid.

### Pareto Frontier Analysis

**Multi-Objective Optimization:**
- Maximize: Accuracy
- Minimize: Latency

**Pareto Frontier:** Configurations where improving one objective worsens another.

**Selection Criteria:**
- Point A: 90% accuracy, 30ms latency
- Point B: 85% accuracy, 15ms latency
- Point C: 88% accuracy, 20ms latency

Point C dominates (better accuracy than B, lower latency than A). Choose C.

### Workload-Specific Tuning

**Sparse Cues (<40% complete):**
- Higher pattern weight (0.5-0.6): Rely more on global patterns
- Lower CA1 threshold (0.6): Accept lower confidence completions
- More hypotheses (5): Explore multiple possibilities

**Rich Cues (>60% complete):**
- Lower pattern weight (0.3-0.4): Trust local temporal context
- Higher CA1 threshold (0.8): Require high confidence
- Fewer hypotheses (2-3): Converge faster

**Adaptive Tuning:** Detect cue completeness, select parameter set accordingly.

## Biological Plausibility Validation

### Cross-Validation with Cognitive Psychology

**Standard Memory Tasks:**
1. **Serial Position:** U-shaped curve (primacy + recency)
2. **DRM Paradigm:** False memory rate <20% (better than humans)
3. **Cue Overload:** Accuracy decreases with >50 similar episodes (Watkins & Watkins, 1975)
4. **Spacing Effect:** Distributed episodes recalled better than massed (Cepeda et al., 2006)

**Engram Validation:** Run each task, compare to human performance in literature.

### Neuroscientific Constraints

**CA3 Convergence:**
- Should match theta rhythm timing (5-7 iterations, ~140ms)
- Energy should decrease monotonically (Hopfield dynamics)
- Sparsity should be 2-5% (biological constraint)

**Pattern Separation:**
- DG should distinguish similar patterns (Leutgeb et al., 2007)
- Measured by pattern separation index: >0.7 for similar episodes

## A/B Testing in Production

### Controlled Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Canary Deployment (5% traffic)**
- Deploy new parameters to 5% of users
- Monitor accuracy, latency, error rate for 48 hours
- Rollback if metrics degrade >10%

**Phase 2: Expanded Rollout (25% traffic)**
- Expand to 25% if canary succeeds
- Monitor for 1 week
- Compare A (old params) vs B (new params)

**Phase 3: Full Rollout (100% traffic)**
- Deploy to all users if A/B shows improvement
- Keep old params as fallback (feature flag)

**Statistical Significance:**
- Minimum 1000 completions per variant
- t-test for accuracy difference (p<0.05)
- Mann-Whitney U for latency distributions (p<0.05)
