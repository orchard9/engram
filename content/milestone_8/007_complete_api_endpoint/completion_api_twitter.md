# Pattern Completion API - Twitter Thread

1/10 The hardest part of building a memory system isn't the algorithms. It's the API.

You've built hippocampal CA3 dynamics, semantic patterns, evidence integration, source attribution, confidence calibration.

Now expose it over HTTP without overwhelming users.

Task 007: Production completion API.

2/10 API design problem:

Pattern completion returns:
- Completed episode
- Calibrated confidence
- Source attribution per field
- Alternative hypotheses
- Metacognitive confidence
- Reconstruction stats

How to expose this complexity cleanly?

3/10 Solution: Progressive disclosure

Minimal request:
```json
POST /api/v1/complete
{
  "partial_episode": {
    "known_fields": {"what": "breakfast"}
  }
}
```

Just what you know. Everything else defaults.

4/10 Core response:
```json
{
  "completed_episode": {...},
  "completion_confidence": 0.82
}
```

Enough for most use cases.

Extended response (verbose=true):
+ source_attribution
+ alternative_hypotheses
+ metacognitive_confidence
+ reconstruction_stats

Full transparency when needed.

5/10 Error handling: Make failures actionable

Bad: "Completion failed"
Good: "Insufficient cue overlap (15% vs 30% required). Add 'when' and 'where' fields or reduce ca1_threshold to 0.6"

User knows: what failed, why, how to fix.

6/10 HTTP status codes:

200 OK: Successful completion
422 Unprocessable Entity: Valid format, insufficient evidence
400 Bad Request: Invalid JSON
404 Not Found: Memory space doesn't exist
500 Internal Server Error: CA3 convergence failure

Use 422 for semantic failures, not 400.

7/10 Multi-tenant routing:

X-Memory-Space: user_alice

Header-based (not URL-based).
- Clean URLs
- O(1) routing
- Matches M7 pattern

Isolation enforced at API layer. No cross-space leakage.

8/10 gRPC for production:

REST: Development, debugging (JSON, human-readable)
gRPC: Production (Protocol Buffers, 5x smaller, HTTP/2)

Streaming completion:
- Pattern retrieval complete
- CA3 convergence progress (iter 3/7)
- Partial result (60% complete)
- Final result

Real-time feedback.

9/10 OpenAPI documentation:

Machine-readable spec → generates:
- Swagger UI (/docs) for interactive testing
- Client libraries (OpenAPI Generator)
- Contract tests (implementation matches spec)

API as code. Self-documenting.

10/10 Performance: <2ms API overhead

Request deserialization: 500μs
Memory space routing: 100μs
Response serialization: 800μs
Framework overhead: 300μs
Total: 1.7ms (10% of completion time)

Zero-copy optimizations. Pre-allocated buffers.

## Technical Deep Dive Thread

1/6 Thread: Implementing zero-copy JSON serialization in Rust

Naive approach: Copy data 3 times
1. Rust struct → intermediate
2. Intermediate → JSON string
3. JSON → HTTP buffer

Cost: ~3ms for large responses. Too slow.

2/6 Zero-copy with serde lifetimes:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct CompleteResponse<'a> {
    #[serde(borrow)]
    completed_episode: &'a Episode,
    // ... other fields
}
```

Borrow episode instead of cloning. Reference semantics.

3/6 Benefits:
- No allocation for episode
- No memcpy for embedding (768 floats)
- Lifetime enforced by compiler

Cost reduction: 3ms → 800μs serialization.
4x speedup from zero-copy.

4/6 Trade-off: Lifetime management

Response must borrow from completion result. Completion result must outlive response serialization.

Axum handlers: Response serialized before handler returns. Lifetimes automatically valid.

Rust borrow checker FTW.

5/6 Pre-allocated buffers:

```rust
thread_local! {
    static BUFFER: RefCell<Vec<u8>> = RefCell::new(Vec::with_capacity(16384));
}

BUFFER.with(|buf| {
    let mut b = buf.borrow_mut();
    b.clear();
    serde_json::to_writer(&mut *b, &response)?;
    // Use buffer
});
```

Reuse allocation across requests. Zero allocation per request.

6/6 Result:

Standard serialization: ~3ms, multiple allocations
Optimized: ~800μs, zero allocations

Within 2ms API overhead budget. Production-ready performance.
