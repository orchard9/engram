# Pattern Completion API: Architectural Perspectives

## Systems Architecture: API as Contract

The API is a contract between implementation and users. Changes break clients. Versioning enables evolution without breakage.

**Semantic Versioning Principles:**
- Major version (v1 → v2): Breaking changes (rename fields, change types)
- Minor version (v1.1 → v1.2): Additive changes (new optional fields)
- Patch version (v1.1.0 → v1.1.1): Bug fixes only

Task 007 implements /api/v1 with OpenAPI schema. Schema is the contract. Implementation must match schema. Contract tests enforce this.

## Rust Performance: Zero-Copy Serialization

Naive JSON serialization copies data multiple times:
1. Rust struct → intermediate representation
2. Intermediate → JSON string
3. JSON string → HTTP response buffer

**Optimization:** serde_json with zero-copy where possible. Reference semantics. Pre-allocated buffers.

```rust
// Zero-copy serialization for large embeddings
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct CompleteResponse<'a> {
    #[serde(borrow)]
    completed_episode: &'a Episode,
    completion_confidence: f32,
    // ... other fields
}
```

Borrow checker ensures lifetime safety. No copies. ~2x faster serialization.

## Multi-Tenant Security: Defense in Depth

Memory space isolation isn't just routing - it's security.

**Threat Model:**
- Malicious user requests completion from another user's space
- Authorization bypass attempts
- Side-channel attacks (timing, error messages)

**Defense Layers:**
1. **Header Validation:** X-Memory-Space must be valid UTF-8, match format
2. **Registry Lookup:** Space must exist in registry (404 if not)
3. **Permission Check:** Requester must have access to space (future: JWT validation)
4. **Isolation Enforcement:** Completion engine scoped to single space

No cross-space data leakage. Even if higher layers fail, registry enforces isolation.

## Error Handling Philosophy: Fail Fast, Fail Informatively

Unix philosophy: Silent success, verbose failure.

Task 007 inverts this for APIs: Structured success, actionable failure.

**Success:** Full response with all context (source attribution, alternatives, stats).
**Failure:** Specific error code, diagnostic details, remediation suggestions.

This matches user needs: Success cases need data. Failure cases need debugging info.
