# Confidence Calibration: Architectural Perspectives

## Cognitive Architecture: Metacognitive Monitoring

Fleming & Dolan: Prefrontal cortex monitors primary memory systems, assesses reliability of own judgments.

Task 006 implements computational metacognition:
- Primary confidence: From CA3 convergence, consensus, plausibility
- Metacognitive confidence: From alternative hypothesis consistency

This mirrors human metacognition: "I remember this, but I'm not sure my memory is reliable."

## Memory Systems: Cue-Based Confidence

Koriat: People use multiple cues to assess confidence (intrinsic, extrinsic, mnemonic).

Task 006's multi-factor confidence:
- Intrinsic: Pattern strength, plausibility (inherent difficulty)
- Extrinsic: Consensus, support count (learning conditions)
- Mnemonic: Convergence speed, energy (retrieval fluency)

Weighted combination of diverse cues produces robust confidence more resistant to individual factor noise.

## Systems Architecture: Continuous Calibration Monitoring

Production systems need drift detection. Data distribution changes → calibration drifts.

Monitoring strategy:
- Track accuracy per confidence bin (real-time)
- Alert if calibration error >10% (threshold)
- Trigger recalibration on validation set (remediation)

Weekly calibration checks. Automated recalibration pipeline. Ensures long-term reliability.

## Rust Performance: Zero-Cost Confidence Tracking

Confidence computation: Four weighted factors + isotonic interpolation.

All arithmetic operations. No allocations. No branching (besides factor selection).

Calibration curve: Pre-computed lookup table (10 bins). Linear interpolation.

Result: <200μs per confidence computation. Negligible overhead in completion pipeline.
