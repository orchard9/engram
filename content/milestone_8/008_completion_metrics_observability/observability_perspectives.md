# Completion Metrics & Observability: Architectural Perspectives

## Systems Architecture: The Four Golden Signals

Google SRE: Monitor latency, traffic, errors, saturation. Applies universally to any service.

Task 008 implements these for pattern completion:
- Latency: Histogram with P50/P95/P99 tracking
- Traffic: Operations per second per memory space
- Errors: Categorized by type (insufficient evidence vs convergence failure)
- Saturation: Pattern cache fullness, memory consumption

This provides complete service health picture. Missing any signal creates blind spots.

## Observability Philosophy: Unknown Unknowns

Monitoring: Known unknowns (predefined dashboards for expected failures).
Observability: Unknown unknowns (arbitrary queries for unexpected behavior).

Metrics + structured logs enable observability:
- Metrics: "Latency spiked at 10:30"
- Logs: "user_alice completion with 12 patterns, CA3 failed to converge"

Root cause analysis becomes structured search, not log grep. Production debugging is deterministic investigation, not guesswork.

## Rust Performance: Zero-Cost Metrics

Counter increment = atomic add = ~20ns.
Histogram observation = atomic add to bucket = ~100ns.

For ~19ms completion, metrics overhead ~2.5Î¼s = 0.013% = negligible.

Rust makes metrics fast:
- Lock-free atomic operations
- Static metric registration (no runtime lookup)
- Zero allocation per observation

Result: Comprehensive instrumentation with <1% overhead.

## Calibration Drift: Self-Correcting Systems

Human-in-loop recalibration doesn't scale. Need automated drift detection.

Strategy:
1. Sample 10% of completions for validation
2. Track accuracy per confidence bin
3. Compute calibration error hourly
4. Alert if error >10% for 3 hours
5. Trigger automatic recalibration pipeline

Self-correcting. Calibration maintained without manual intervention.
