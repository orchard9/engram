# Twitter Thread: Hardening Engram's Memory Engine for Multi-Tenant Use

## Thread Structure

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Engram builds a cognitive memory system, but right now every agent shares one brain.

Milestone 7 changes that: we’re giving each agent its own "memory space" without sacrificing spreading activation or probabilistic recall.

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
Today the CLI boots a single `MemoryStore` and every HTTP/gRPC request writes into it. One rogue agent? Everyone’s memories mutate (`engram-cli/src/main.rs:171-236`; `engram-cli/src/api.rs:789-904`).

### Tweet 3 (Root Cause)
`MemoryStore` is a giant bundle of DashMaps, eviction queues, and HNSW queues with no tenant key. Deduplication, WAL buffering, activation—all global (`engram-core/src/store.rs:218-299`).

### Tweet 4 (Solution Outline)
Introduce a `MemorySpaceId` registry. Each space maps to its own store handle, persistence root, and metrics slice. Handlers fetch the right handle before touching the graph.

### Tweet 5 (Engine Work)
We’re threading space IDs through `store()`, `recall()`, and the spreading pipeline so activation never hops out of its space (`engram-core/src/store.rs:1788-1833`).

### Tweet 6 (Observability)
Events and metrics get space labels. Dashboards finally answer “which agent triggered this activation spike?” (`engram-core/src/store.rs:181-206`).

### Tweet 7 (Backward Compatibility)
Legacy clients still work: omit the header and you land in the default space. But logs warn you until you migrate.

### Tweet 8 (Validation)
New fuzz + integration suites hammer concurrent spaces, crash-recover each WAL, and diff recall results. No leaks allowed.

### Tweet 9 (Call to Action)
Want to help? Review Milestone 7 tasks, especially engine isolation + validation. We’re hiring contributors who love graph engines and cognitive systems.
