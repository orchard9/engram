1. **Activation Spreading Streams**
   ```rust
   // Clear mental model: spreading as river flow
   let activation_stream = memory.spread_activation()
       .with_decay(0.8)  // Energy dissipates
       .max_hops(3)      // Bounded spreading
       .threshold(0.1)   // Minimum activation
       .stream();        // Returns Stream<ActivationEvent>
   
   // Visual debugging
   activation_stream
       .inspect(|event| visualizer.show_spread(event))
       .collect();
   ```

2. **Memory Consolidation Monitoring**
   ```rust
   // Server-Sent Events for real-time consolidation
   async fn consolidation_events() -> impl Stream<Item = Event> {
       engram.consolidation_stream()
           .filter_map(|event| {
               match event {
                   // Progressive disclosure
                   Basic(e) => Some(json!({
                       "type": "consolidation",

       .scan(1.0, |confidence, memory| {
           *confidence *= 0.95; // Decay over time
           Some((memory, *confidence))
       })
       .take_while(|(_, conf)| *conf > 0.1)
       .buffer_unordered(4); // Parallel processing
