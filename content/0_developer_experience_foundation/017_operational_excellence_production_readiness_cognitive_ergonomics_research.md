## Implementation Recommendations for Engram

### For Production Readiness

1. **Health Check Design**
   ```rust
   // Progressive health disclosure
   enum HealthLevel {
       Basic,     // Simple up/down
       Standard,  // Component status
       Detailed,  // Full diagnostics
   }
   
   impl HealthCheck {
       fn report(&self, level: HealthLevel) -> HealthReport {
           match level {
               Basic => HealthReport {
                   status: self.is_healthy(),
                   message: "System operational"
               },
               Standard => HealthReport {
                   status: self.component_health(),
                   message: self.describe_issues(),
                   components: self.list_components()
               },
               Detailed => HealthReport {
                   status: self.detailed_diagnostics(),
                   metrics: self.collect_metrics(),
                   dependencies: self.check_dependencies(),
                   recommendations: self.suggest_actions()
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Operational Documentation**
   ```markdown
   # Memory System Operations
   
   ## Quick Status (< 30 seconds)
   1. Check: `engram status`
   2. Look for: GREEN status, <100ms latency
   3. If not GREEN: See "Troubleshooting"
   
   ## Standard Health Check (2 minutes)
   1. Run: `engram health --detailed`
   2. Verify each component:
      - Memory store: >90% available
      - Activation engine: <50ms spread time
      - Consolidation: Active or Idle
   3. Check recent errors: `engram errors --recent`
   
   ## Troubleshooting Decision Tree
   Is the system responding?
   ├─ No → Check process: `ps aux | grep engram`
   │   └─ Not running → `engram start`
   └─ Yes → Check health: `engram health`
       ├─ Memory issues → Clear cache: `engram consolidate --force`
       └─ Performance issues → Check metrics: `engram metrics`
   ```

       logs: Vec<LogEntry>,
   }
   
   impl IncidentCollector {
       fn on_incident(&mut self) {
           // Automatically collect context
           self.snapshot_metrics();
           self.capture_recent_logs();
           self.save_active_traces();
           
           // Generate initial report
           let report = self.generate_report();
           
           // Notify operators with context
           notify::send(Notification {
               severity: High,
               summary: report.executive_summary(),
               details_url: report.upload_url(),

               health: self.encode_health_color(),
               
               // Progressive disclosure
               summary: self.primary_metrics.summarize(),
               details: if self.detail_level.is_expanded() {
                   Some(self.secondary_metrics())

                   .apply(self.active_alerts())
                   .limit(3)  // Prevent overload
