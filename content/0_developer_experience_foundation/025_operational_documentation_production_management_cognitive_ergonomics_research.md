# Operational Documentation and Production Management Cognitive Ergonomics Research

## Overview

Operational documentation for memory systems faces unique cognitive challenges because operators must manage probabilistic behaviors, confidence thresholds, and spreading activation patterns under production stress. Research shows that 90% of operators don't read documentation until something breaks (Rettig 1991), making scannable, action-oriented documentation critical for incident response. For memory systems with complex state machines and emergent behaviors, operational documentation must serve as both learning tool and emergency reference while respecting cognitive limits under pressure.

## Research Topics

### 1. Procedural Memory and Context-Action-Verification Patterns

**The CAV Framework for Operations**
Research from instructional design demonstrates that procedural documentation following Context-Action-Verification (CAV) structure improves task completion by 67% compared to traditional formats (Carroll 1990). This pattern maps to how humans encode and execute procedural memory—understanding situation, performing action, confirming success.

Key findings:
- Context establishment reduces errors by 45% by preventing actions in wrong situations
- Explicit action steps with exact commands reduce cognitive translation effort by 52%
- Verification criteria enable self-assessment and error detection before propagation
- Procedural patterns persist in memory longer than declarative knowledge

**Memory System CAV Implementation:**
Operations on memory systems require careful context awareness because actions like consolidation or spreading activation can have system-wide effects. CAV documentation ensures operators understand current state before acting and can verify successful completion.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure and Cognitive Load Management

**Information Architecture for Stressed Operators**
Krug (2000) demonstrated that progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load by 34% in technical documentation. For operational procedures, this means presenting common operations prominently while making advanced scenarios discoverable but not overwhelming.

Progressive disclosure hierarchy:
1. **Emergency Procedures**: Immediately visible, minimal cognitive load
2. **Common Operations**: Start, stop, restart, basic health checks
3. **Maintenance Tasks**: Backup, restore, performance tuning
4. **Advanced Scenarios**: Disaster recovery, complex troubleshooting
5. **Deep Diagnostics**: System internals, architectural details

**Cognitive Load Indicators:**
Each procedure should include explicit cognitive load ratings:
- **Low**: Can be performed while multitasking
- **Medium**: Requires focused attention
- **High**: Requires deep concentration and possibly team coordination

### 3. Mental Model Diagrams and System Visualization

**Visual Representation of Memory System Behavior**
Norman (1988) found that mental model diagrams reduce operational errors by 45% by providing external representations of system behavior. For memory systems, visual diagrams must capture both static architecture and dynamic behaviors like spreading activation and confidence propagation.

Essential diagrams for memory systems:
- **System Architecture**: Components and data flow
- **State Transitions**: Valid states and transitions for memories
- **Spreading Activation Flow**: How activation propagates through graph
- **Confidence Boundaries**: Thresholds and their effects
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, network patterns

**Dynamic Visualization Needs:**
Static diagrams can't capture memory system dynamics. Documentation should include animated visualizations or step-by-step progression diagrams showing how operations affect system state over time.

### 4. Decision Trees and Diagnostic Mental Models

**Systematic Troubleshooting Under Pressure**
Klein (1989) demonstrated that decision trees improve diagnosis speed by 52% by preventing cognitive fixation on incorrect hypotheses. For memory systems, decision trees must account for probabilistic behaviors that don't have deterministic root causes.

Decision tree principles:
- **Symptom-First Navigation**: Start with what operators observe
- **Binary Decisions**: Each node asks yes/no question
- **Confidence Levels**: Include probability of each diagnosis path
- **Escape Hatches**: Clear escalation points when tree doesn't resolve issue

**Memory System Diagnostic Patterns:**
Troubleshooting spreading activation timeouts requires different mental models than traditional query timeouts. Decision trees must help operators distinguish between algorithmic complexity, graph connectivity issues, and resource constraints.

### 5. Executable Documentation and Configuration Validation

**Reducing Translation Errors Through Automation**
Spinellis (2003) found that executable documentation reduces configuration errors by 71% by eliminating manual translation from documentation to commands. For memory systems, this means providing copy-paste commands and validation scripts.

Executable documentation components:
- **Copy-Paste Commands**: Exact commands with parameters clearly marked
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated checks that verify correct configuration
- **Idempotent Procedures**: Operations safe to repeat if uncertain
- **Rollback Commands**: Every change includes reversal procedure

**Memory System Executability:**
Operations like adjusting confidence thresholds or consolidation parameters should include immediate validation commands that verify the change took effect and system remains healthy.

### 6. Incident Response Playbooks and Cognitive Scripts

**Automating Decision-Making Under Stress**
Research on expert decision-making shows that experienced operators develop cognitive scripts—memorized action sequences for common scenarios. Playbooks externalize these scripts, reducing cognitive load during incidents.

Playbook structure for memory systems:
1. **Symptom Recognition**: Clear indicators this playbook applies
2. **Immediate Actions**: Stabilization steps requiring no analysis
3. **Investigation Steps**: Systematic information gathering
4. **Resolution Paths**: Common fixes with success indicators
5. **Escalation Criteria**: When to involve additional expertise

**Cognitive Script Development:**
Each playbook should be designed to become internalized as cognitive script through repeated use. This requires consistent structure, memorable mnemonics, and regular drill exercises.

### 7. Performance Tuning and Capacity Planning

**Mental Models for System Optimization**
Performance tuning documentation must help operators develop accurate mental models of system behavior under load. For memory systems, this includes understanding how confidence thresholds affect performance, how graph density impacts spreading activation, and how consolidation frequency affects resource usage.

Performance documentation components:
- **Baseline Metrics**: Normal operating ranges for key indicators
- **Scaling Patterns**: How metrics change with load
- **Tuning Levers**: Parameters that affect performance
- **Trade-off Matrices**: Performance vs accuracy vs resource usage
- **Optimization Workflows**: Systematic tuning procedures

**Capacity Planning for Probabilistic Systems:**
Unlike deterministic databases, memory system capacity depends on usage patterns. Documentation must help operators understand how spreading activation depth, confidence thresholds, and memory interconnectedness affect resource requirements.

### 8. Backup, Recovery, and Disaster Resilience

**Cognitive Confidence Through Preparation**
Disaster recovery documentation must build operator confidence through clear procedures, regular testing evidence, and explicit success criteria. For memory systems with complex state, recovery procedures must address both data restoration and state consistency.

Recovery documentation requirements:
- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Clear expectations for restoration duration
- **Recovery Point Objectives**: Data loss tolerances
- **Dependency Sequencing**: Order of system restoration
- **Validation Procedures**: Confirming successful recovery
- **Partial Recovery Options**: Operating with degraded functionality

**Memory System Recovery Complexity:**
Restoring a memory system requires more than data recovery—spreading activation indices, confidence scores, and consolidation state must be consistent. Documentation must address these unique requirements.

## Current State Assessment

Based on analysis of existing operational documentation practices:

**Strengths:**
- Strong research foundation in procedural documentation design
- Clear understanding of cognitive load under operational stress
- Established patterns for decision trees and troubleshooting

**Gaps:**
- Limited research on documenting probabilistic system operations
- Need for better visualization of dynamic memory behaviors
- Insufficient patterns for capacity planning non-deterministic systems

**Research Priorities:**
1. Empirical studies of operator mental models for memory systems
2. Development of interactive visualization tools for documentation
3. Validation of playbook effectiveness under stress conditions
4. Capacity planning models for probabilistic operations

## Implementation Research

### Context-Action-Verification Procedure Format

**CAV Structure for Memory Operations:**
```markdown
## Starting Memory System

**CONTEXT**: When to perform this procedure
- System is fully stopped (verify with `engram status`)
- All dependencies are running (check with `engram deps check`)
- Sufficient resources available (minimum 4GB RAM, 10GB disk)

**ACTION**: Step-by-step procedure
1. Verify prerequisites:
   ```bash
   engram deps check
   # Expected output: All dependencies ✓
   ```

2. Start system with monitoring:
   ```bash
   engram start --verbose --monitor
   ```

3. Wait for initialization (typical: 15-45 seconds):
   - Loading memories: Progress bar shows count
   - Building indices: CPU usage spikes to 100%
   - Warming caches: Memory usage increases gradually

**VERIFICATION**: Confirming successful start
- Health check passes:
  ```bash
  engram health
  # Expected: STATUS: healthy, READY: true
  ```
- Metrics within normal range:
  ```bash
  engram metrics summary
  # Memory usage: 2-4GB
  # CPU usage: <20% idle
  # Response time: <100ms
  ```
- Test query succeeds:
  ```bash
  engram query "test memory" --limit 1
  # Should return at least one result
  ```

**TROUBLESHOOTING**: If verification fails
- If health check fails: See "Troubleshooting Startup Failures"
- If metrics abnormal: See "Performance Tuning Guide"
- If query fails: Check spreading activation configuration
```

### Performance Tuning Playbook

**Systematic Optimization Procedure:**
```markdown
# Playbook: High Query Latency

## SYMPTOMS
- P95 latency > 500ms
- User complaints about slow responses
- CPU usage normal (<50%)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (2 minutes)
1. Check current metrics:
   ```bash
   engram metrics latency --percentiles
   ```

2. Verify no ongoing consolidation:
   ```bash
   engram consolidation status
   ```

3. Pause non-critical operations:
   ```bash
   engram maintenance pause
   ```

## INVESTIGATION (5 minutes)
1. Analyze query patterns:
   ```bash
   engram analyze queries --last-hour --slow
   ```

2. Check spreading activation depth:
   ```bash
   engram config get spreading_max_depth
   ```

3. Review confidence thresholds:
   ```bash
   engram config get confidence_threshold
   ```

## RESOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option A: Threshold Too Low (Most Common)
Confidence threshold <0.3 causes excessive exploration

**Fix**:
```bash
# Increase threshold gradually
engram config set confidence_threshold 0.4
engram metrics watch latency --duration 60s

# If improved, continue increasing
engram config set confidence_threshold 0.5
```

**Success Criteria**: P95 latency <200ms

### Option B: Graph Too Dense
High connectivity causing exponential exploration

**Fix**:
```bash
# Limit exploration depth
engram config set spreading_max_depth 3
engram config set spreading_timeout_ms 100
```

**Success Criteria**: Query timeout rate <1%

## VERIFICATION
- Latency back to normal range
- No increase in empty results
- User satisfaction restored

## ESCALATION
If resolution unsuccessful after 15 minutes:
- Page on-call engineer
- Provide query analysis output
- Consider rolling back recent changes
```
