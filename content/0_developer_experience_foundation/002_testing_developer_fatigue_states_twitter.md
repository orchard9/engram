# Twitter Thread: Testing Developer Fatigue States

🧠 1/15 Most error testing focuses on "is this message accurate?" But that misses the real question: "Does this error make developers better at programming?"

Every error experience either builds useful skills or reinforces bad mental models. 🧵

---

🔬 2/15 Your brain has two memory systems:
- Declarative: facts & events (fails under stress)  
- Procedural: skills & habits (robust under fatigue)

At 3am, you can't recall what "NodeNotFound" means, but you CAN execute learned procedures automatically.

---

❌ 3/15 Traditional error (stores a fact):
```
Error: Memory node 'user_123' not found
```

You have to consciously reason through this every. single. time.

---

✅ 4/15 Procedural error (builds a skill):
```  
Memory node 'user_123' not found
Expected: Valid node ID from graph
Suggestion: Use graph.nodes() to list available
Example: graph.get_node("user_id").or_insert_default()
```

After 3-4 encounters, this becomes automatic.

---

🎯 5/15 The key insight: **Pattern consistency enables memory consolidation**

When similar errors follow the same format (Context-Suggestion-Example), your brain builds ONE reusable procedure instead of memorizing dozens of special cases.

---

🔄 6/15 Inconsistent patterns prevent learning:
```rust
CoreError::NodeNotFound("user_123") // Just problem
StorageError::Missing { context: "..." } // Problem + context  
ApiError::Invalid { suggestion: "..." } // Problem + suggestion
```

Each format requires separate mental processing.

---

🎵 7/15 Consistent patterns enable learning:
```rust
cognitive_error!(
    summary: "Node 'user_123' not found",
    context: expected = "valid ID", actual = "user_123", 
    suggestion: "Check available nodes",
    example: "graph.get_node(\"user_124\")"
);
```

Same pattern → consolidated procedure → automatic response.

---

🧪 8/15 This changes how we test errors. Instead of just testing accuracy, test LEARNING OUTCOMES:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_procedural_knowledge_transfer() {
    let procedure = extract_suggested_procedure(&error_message);
    
    assert!(procedure.is_executable());
    assert!(procedure.solves_problem(&error));
    assert!(procedure.generalizes_to_similar_cases());
}
```

---

📊 9/15 Memory-aware testing validates:

✅ Pattern consistency across error families
✅ Procedural knowledge transfer to similar problems  
✅ Context independence (works in any situation)
✅ Learning curve improvement over time

---

🎯 10/15 Test longitudinal consistency:
```rust
#[test] 
fn test_memory_persistence() {
    // Present same error type 10 times with different details
    for i in 0..10 {
        let experience = simulator.encounter_error(error_type);
        // Time to recognition should decrease
        assert!(experience.time_to_recognition < 30_secs);
    }
}
```

---

🔬 11/15 The hippocampus stores memories with rich context. Errors should work across contexts without requiring developers to remember "where did I see this before?"

Context-dependent errors are fragile. Context-independent errors are robust.

---

⚡ 12/15 Implementation strategy: Build infrastructure that tracks error patterns across your entire codebase.

Every error family should follow consistent cognitive patterns. Your CI should fail if errors don't build proper procedural knowledge.

---

📈 13/15 The compound effect is incredible:

- Month 1: Solve individual bugs faster
- Month 6: Develop better debugging intuition  
- Year 1: Make fewer similar mistakes
- Year 2: Help teammates more effectively

Better errors → better developers

---

🚀 14/15 This isn't just theory. We're implementing this approach in @engram_db's cognitive graph database.

Every error is designed as a learning experience that builds procedural memory. Testing validates learning outcomes, not just accuracy.

---

💡 15/15 Key takeaway: Treat error testing as learning experience design.

You're not just preventing bad errors—you're actively building good developers. Every error message is a small teaching moment that compounds over a career.

What errors have taught you the most? 🤔
