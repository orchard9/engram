# Operational Excellence and the Three-Level Problem: A Twitter Thread

## Thread

**1/**
Your monitoring dashboard has 200 green lights.

Your system is about to crash.

You have no idea.

This is the three-level problem of production systems ðŸ§µ

**2/**
Situation awareness has three levels (Endsley 1995):

Level 1: Perception (what's happening)
Level 2: Comprehension (what it means)
Level 3: Projection (what's next)

Most monitoring stops at level 1. We see metrics but don't understand state.

**3/**
Research: 73% of incidents are detected faster through PATTERNS than metrics (Woods & Hollnagel 2006).

Yet we keep adding metrics instead of pattern recognition.

Your operators don't need more data. They need comprehension.

**4/**
Expert operators don't analyze during incidentsâ€”they RECOGNIZE patterns.

87% of critical incident decisions are pattern-matching, not analysis (Klein 1993).

"That's a thundering herd"
"Classic death spiral"
"Cascade incoming"

Build pattern libraries, not metric lakes.

**5/**
Your brain can track 5-7 pieces of information.

Your dashboard shows 200.

Cognitive overload starts at just 7 simultaneous metrics (Few 2006).

This isn't an operator problem. It's a design problem.

**6/**
Cognitive-friendly dashboard:
```
Level 1: 4 indicators max
â”œâ”€ Overall health
â”œâ”€ Capacity remaining  
â”œâ”€ Active patterns
â””â”€ Trend direction

Level 2: On demand
Level 3: During incidents only
```

Progressive disclosure. Respect cognitive limits.

**7/**
The incident paradox:

Stress reduces cognitive performance by 45% (Kontogiannis 1999).

Yet incident procedures require MORE cognitive work, not less.

Solution: Automate evidence collection. Generate hypotheses. Offload analysis. Let humans judge.

**8/**
What actually helps during incidents:

Automated:
- Evidence collection
- Pattern matching
- Hypothesis generation
- Runbook retrieval
Human judgment for:
- Go/no-go decisions
- Risk assessment
- Communication
- Novel situations

**9/**
The documentation nobody reads:

90% of operators don't read docs before starting (Rettig 1991).

They read when things break.

Solution: Decision trees, not novels.
"If X, then Y"
"Red component? Do Z"

Scannable. Actionable. 3am-friendly.

**10/**
Trust in automation requires understanding (Lee & See 2004):
- Performance (what it does well/poorly)
- Process (how it decides)
- Purpose (why it exists)

Most prod automation is opaque. No wonder operators don't trust it.

Show your work. Explain decisions. Allow overrides.

**11/**
Blameless post-mortems improve reporting by 47% (Allspaw 2012).

Why? Psychological safety enables learning.

Blame â†’ People hide problems
Learning â†’ People share near-misses

You want to know about the 10 near-misses before the 1 disaster.

**12/**
The expertise paradox (Bainbridge 1983):

Automation handles easy cases.
Humans handle hard cases.
But without practice on easy cases, humans lose skills.

73% of operators can't handle automation failures effectively.

Solution: Rotation. Game days. Manual mode practice.

**13/**
Progressive operational maturity:
1. Basic health checks (up/down)
2. Component health (per service)
3. Pattern detection (behavioral)
4. Projection capability (predictive)
5. Self-healing (autonomous)

Each level builds on the previous. Don't skip steps.

**14/**
Production readiness isn't about tools.

It's about cognitive fit:
- Patterns over metrics
- Progressive disclosure
- Cognitive offloading
- Trust through transparency
- Learning from incidents

Your system should be understandable by a tired human at 3am.

**15/**
The three levels again:

Perception: Your current dashboards
Comprehension: Pattern recognition  
Projection: What happens next

Most teams have level 1.
Excellence requires all three.

Build systems humans can actually operate.

**16/**
We've built production systems that exceed human cognitive capacity.

Then we blame operators when things fail.

The solution isn't superhuman operators.

It's systems designed for actual humans.

Respect cognitive limits. Build knowable systems.

**17/**
Engram's approach:
- Max 4 primary indicators
- Pattern library not metric soup
- Automated incident analysis
- Decision tree runbooks
- Transparent automation

Production excellence through cognitive ergonomics.

**18/**
Next time you add a metric, ask:

Does this build perception, comprehension, or projection?

If it's just another green light in a sea of green lights, you're making your system LESS knowable.

Build for the operator at 3am. They'll thank you.
