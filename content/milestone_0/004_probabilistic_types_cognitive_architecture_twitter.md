# Twitter Thread: The Psychology of Uncertainty in Code

🧠 1/17 Most confidence types are designed for mathematical correctness, not human psychology. The result? Developers struggle with probabilistic reasoning, make systematic errors, and write buggy uncertain code.

Research shows we can do better by designing probabilistic types for human cognition. 🧵

---

🔬 2/17 Human brains didn't evolve for decimal probabilities. Research by Gigerenzer & Hoffrage shows people excel at frequency reasoning ("3 out of 10") but fail at probability reasoning ("0.3 chance").

Yet most APIs force the probability mindset:
```rust
let confidence = Confidence::new(0.847291634)?;
```

---

❌ 3/17 This creates cognitive overhead everywhere:

• Mental math: what does 0.847 mean?
• Arbitrary thresholds: why 0.8 not 0.79?  
• Precision anxiety: is 0.8500000001 ≠ 0.85?
• No intuition: does 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42 feel right?

Each operation requires conscious mathematical reasoning that breaks under cognitive load.

---

🧠 4/17 Worse: humans have systematic biases in probabilistic reasoning.

**Overconfidence Bias**: Developers overestimate certainty by 15-30%
**Base Rate Neglect**: Ignore prior probabilities
**Conjunction Fallacy**: Think (A AND B) > A

Most confidence types amplify these biases instead of preventing them.

---

🎯 5/17 The solution: **Design for human cognitive architecture**

Research shows humans have two reasoning systems:
• System 1: Automatic, intuitive, works under stress  
• System 2: Analytical, conscious, fails under load

Current APIs require System 2 for everything. We need System 1-friendly operations.

---

❌ 6/17 System 2-Heavy (avoid):
```rust
// Requires conscious math
if (conf1.value() * conf2.value()) > threshold { ... }

// Complex working memory demands  
let result = bayesian_update(prior, likelihood, evidence);
```

✅ System 1-Friendly (prefer):
```rust  
// Intuitive and automatic
if confidence.is_high() { ... }

// Natural combinations
let combined = belief1.and(belief2);
```

---

🔄 7/17 **Memory Systems Matter**

The brain has two memory types:
• Declarative: facts (fails under stress)
• Procedural: skills (robust under fatigue)

Bad: Store declarative knowledge
```rust
let confidence = 0.847; // "This has confidence 0.847"
```

Good: Build procedural knowledge  
```rust
let confidence = Confidence::seems_legitimate(); // "This seems legit"
```

---

🎵 8/17 **Procedural Knowledge Through Consistent Patterns**

After repetition, these become automatic:
```rust
let spam_confidence = detector.classify(email);
if spam_confidence.is_high() {
    move_to_spam();
} else if spam_confidence.is_low() { 
    mark_legitimate();
} else {
    flag_for_review();
}
```

Pattern becomes: High→Act, Low→Opposite, Medium→Investigate

---

📊 9/17 **Working Memory Constraints**

Humans can only hold 3-7 items under cognitive load. Complex operations exceed this:

Bad:
```rust
confidence
  .bayesian_update(prior, likelihood, evidence)
  .combine_with_base_rate(rate)
  .calibrate(dataset)
  .adjust_for_bias(factor);
```

Good: Single concept per operation
```rust
let updated = confidence.update_with(evidence);
let calibrated = updated.calibrate();
```

💡 10/17 **Cognitive Confidence Design Principles**

1. **Frequency-based constructors**: `from_successes(3, 10)` not `new(0.3)`
2. **Qualitative categories**: `HIGH`/`MEDIUM`/`LOW` not decimals
3. **Logical operations**: `and`/`or` not multiplication
4. **Bias prevention**: Built into type system
5. **Zero cost**: Compiles to f32 in release

---

🔍 11/17 **Example: Bias Prevention in Types**

```rust
impl Confidence {
    // Prevents conjunction fallacy at compile time
    pub fn and(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        // Always ≤ min(self, other) - mathematically impossible to violate
        Self((self.0 * other.0).min(self.0.min(other.0)))
    }
    
    // Forces base rate awareness
    pub fn with_base_rate(&self, base_rate: BaseRate) -> CalibratedConfidence {
        // Can't ignore priors - they're required by the type system
    }
}
```

---

🎯 12/17 **Natural Language Operations**

Instead of mathematical abstractions, use cognitive ones:

```rust
// Mathematical thinking (hard)
if confidence.value() > 0.8 { ... }

// Natural thinking (easy)  
if confidence.is_high() { ... }
if evidence.supports(hypothesis) { ... }
if belief.contradicts(other_belief) { ... }
```

These feel automatic because they match natural language patterns.

---

🔬 13/17 **Real-World Impact**

When confidence types align with cognition:

Week 1: Less mental math, fewer docs lookups
Month 1: Better debugging intuition
Month 6: Natural uncertainty reasoning
Year 1: Transferable probabilistic expertise

Cognitive alignment creates compound returns on developer investment.

---

🚀 14/17 At @engram_db, we're implementing cognitive confidence types:

```rust
// Frequency-based (natural)
let conf = Confidence::from_successes(7, 10);

// Qualitative (intuitive)  
if conf.is_high() { proceed_confidently(); }

// Logical (familiar)
let combined = belief_a.and(belief_b);
```

Zero runtime cost, maximum cognitive ergonomics.

---

📋 15/17 **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Audit current patterns**: Find raw probabilities, Option<f32>, magic thresholds
2. **Design for mental models**: Frequency constructors, qualitative categories  
3. **Build bias prevention**: Use type system to prevent cognitive errors
4. **Measure cognitive metrics**: Time-to-comprehension, calibration accuracy

---

🎯 16/17 **The Key Insight**

Uncertainty isn't a mathematical concept that developers must learn to manipulate correctly.

Uncertainty is a **cognitive primitive**—humans have natural mental models for confidence, belief, and doubt.

Design probabilistic types that work WITH human psychology, not against it.

---

💡 17/17 **The Future of Probabilistic Programming**

It's not better algorithms or more sophisticated math.

It's probabilistic types designed for the most important constraint in any software system: **the human cognitive architecture** of the developers who build and maintain it.

What cognitive biases have you noticed in your probabilistic code? 🤔
