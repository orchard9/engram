## Thread (25 tweets)

When you choose "Episode" over "Record" in your API schema, you're not just picking a label.

You're selecting a mental framework that will shape how thousands of developers think about your system.

Thread on the psychology of API schema design üëá

Research insight: Rich domain vocabulary improves API comprehension by 67% compared to generic terms (Rosch et al. 1976).

"Episode" activates mental models of:
‚Ä¢ Temporal context
‚Ä¢ Narrative structure  
‚Ä¢ Memory patterns

"Record" activates nothing specific.

The semantic priming effect in action:

‚ùå `message Record { string data = 1; }`
‚úÖ `message Episode { string content = 1; }`

When developers see "Episode," their minds unconsciously activate related concepts, reducing cognitive load.

**Tweet 4/25** üéØ
Progressive complexity respects working memory limits (7¬±2 items):

Level 1: `BasicEpisode` (3 fields)
Level 2: `Episode` (grouped chunks) 
Level 3: `DetailedEpisode` (expert features)

Same foundation, different complexity levels.

The Optional<Confidence> anti-pattern:

```protobuf
optional Confidence confidence = 2;  // Wrong!
```

When confidence is missing, developers assume certainty.

Always make uncertainty explicit, never optional.

**Tweet 6/25** ‚úÖ
Always-present confidence handles human psychology:

```protobuf
message Result {
  Episode episode = 1;
  Confidence confidence = 2;  // Required!
}
```

Every operation has uncertainty. Making it optional creates cognitive traps.

**Tweet 7/25** üé®
Dual confidence representation serves different needs:

```protobuf  
message Confidence {
  float score = 1;          // For algorithms
  ConfidenceLevel level = 2; // For humans
  string reasoning = 3;      // For transparency
}
```

Numeric precision + qualitative categories.

**Tweet 8/25** üß©
Field organization using Gestalt principles:

Instead of random field order, group semantically:
‚Ä¢ What happened? (content group)
‚Ä¢ When? (temporal group)
‚Ä¢ How confident? (certainty group)
‚Ä¢ Storage details (implementation)

Chunking reduces cognitive load.

**Tweet 9/25** üìö
Self-documenting schemas reduce context switching by 23%:

```protobuf
// Activation strength representing consolidation success
// Range: [0.0, 1.0] based on Hebbian learning principles  
// Lower values suggest interference or attention deficits
float activation_level = 1;
```

Code becomes teaching tool.

**Tweet 10/25** üõ°Ô∏è
Type safety prevents cognitive errors:

‚ùå Optional confidence ‚Üí "null means certain" bug
‚úÖ Required confidence ‚Üí impossible to ignore uncertainty

Strong typing moves errors from runtime (stress) to compile-time (safety).

**Tweet 11/25** üé™
Semantic types vs generic containers:

Generic:
```protobuf
repeated bytes data = 1;  // What kind?
```

Semantic:
```protobuf  
repeated MemoryResult vivid_memories = 1;
repeated MemoryResult vague_recollections = 2;
```

Type system carries meaning.

**Tweet 12/25** üìà
Schema evolution must preserve mental models:

```protobuf
message Episode {
  // V1 fields (never change numbers)
  string content = 1;
  
  // V2 additions (use 10+ range)  
  repeated string tags = 10;  // Not field 3!
}
```

Extend, don't replace existing patterns.

**Tweet 13/25** üèóÔ∏è
Field numbering strategy for long-term health:

1-9: Core fields (high-frequency)
10-19: Extended fields (medium-frequency)  
20-29: Advanced fields (power users)
30-39: Reserved for future

Numbers communicate importance hierarchy.

**Tweet 14/25** üîÑ
Natural language in service methods:

‚ùå `rpc Create(Data) returns (Response)`
‚úÖ `rpc Remember(Episode) returns (MemoryFormation)`

Method names should read like domain actions, not CRUD operations.

**Tweet 15/25** üí°
Progressive disclosure in message hierarchies:

Novices see simple types
Regular users see rich types
Experts see detailed types

Same conceptual foundation, appropriate complexity for each audience.

**Tweet 16/25** üéØ
Confidence categories matching human psychology:

VIVID: High-confidence direct recall
VAGUE: Medium-confidence associative
RECONSTRUCTED: Low-confidence schema-based

These align with actual memory phenomena.

**Tweet 17/25** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Common schema anti-patterns:

‚Ä¢ Optional uncertainty information
‚Ä¢ Generic field names (data, info, item)
‚Ä¢ Flat field organization (no grouping)
‚Ä¢ Abbreviations over clarity
‚Ä¢ Evolution that breaks mental models

**Tweet 18/25** üîç
Self-documenting field examples:

‚ùå `float score`
‚úÖ `float activation_level // [0.0-1.0] consolidation strength`

‚ùå `string data`  
‚úÖ `string content // Episodic memory content`

Names + comments teach domain concepts.

**Tweet 19/25** üß†
Working memory constraints in practice:

Instead of 15 flat fields, organize into 4 conceptual groups:
‚Ä¢ Core (what/when)
‚Ä¢ Confidence (uncertainty info)  
‚Ä¢ Context (rich details)
‚Ä¢ Technical (storage/perf)

Chunking expands effective capacity.

**Tweet 20/25** üé®
Visual field organization matters:

Related fields should be:
‚Ä¢ Grouped together (proximity)
‚Ä¢ Named consistently (similarity)
‚Ä¢ Numbered logically (sequence)

Pre-attentive processing reveals structure <200ms.

Network effects of good schema design:

Good schemas ‚Üí faster adoption ‚Üí better docs ‚Üí fewer support issues ‚Üí more contributors ‚Üí ecosystem growth

Poor schemas ‚Üí confusion ‚Üí frustration ‚Üí abandonment ‚Üí fragmentation

Schema as cognitive architecture checklist:

‚ñ° Rich domain vocabulary  
‚ñ° Progressive complexity
‚ñ° Always-present confidence
‚ñ° Semantic field grouping
‚ñ° Self-documenting structure
‚ñ° Type-safe uncertainty
‚ñ° Evolution-friendly numbering

**Tweet 23/25** üî¨
Research-backed design principles:

‚Ä¢ Semantic priming improves comprehension 67%
‚Ä¢ Working memory holds 7¬±2 items
‚Ä¢ Context switching increases load 23%
‚Ä¢ Strong typing reduces cognitive errors
‚Ä¢ Qualitative categories > raw probabilities

**Tweet 24/25** üéØ
The confidence paradox:

Making uncertainty optional doesn't increase flexibility.
It creates the "null confidence = certainty" cognitive bug.

Every operation has uncertainty. Make it explicit, never optional.

**Tweet 25/25** üß†
API schema design is applied cognitive science.

You're not just defining data structures - you're architecting the mental frameworks that will shape how developers understand your system.

Choose vocabulary that activates the right neural pathways.
