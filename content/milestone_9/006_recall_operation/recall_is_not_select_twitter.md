# Twitter Thread: RECALL Is Not SELECT

## Thread

**Tweet 1/10** (Hook)

RECALL is not SELECT. And if you're building AI memory systems, understanding this difference isn't academic - it's fundamental.

Here's why cognitive queries need different semantics than database queries, and what that means for real systems.

---

**Tweet 2/10** (The Confidence Problem)

SQL treats confidence as data:
```sql
SELECT * WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

That 0.9 you stored last week? Still 0.9 today.

But memory confidence DECAYS. That 0.9 from 3 days ago is now 0.77.

RECALL computes this dynamically. SQL stores it statically. Huge difference.

---

**Tweet 3/10** (The Similarity Problem)

SQL: Find "API design"
```sql
WHERE description LIKE '%API%design%'
```

Misses: "interface specification", "REST endpoint planning"

RECALL: Semantic similarity in embedding space
```
WHERE content SIMILAR TO api_design_embedding
```

Finds all semantically related concepts, not just string matches.

---

**Tweet 4/10** (The Uncertainty Problem)

SQL returns discrete results:
- Alice: matches
- Bob: matches
- Charlie: doesn't match

RECALL returns probabilistic distributions:
- Episode 1: 92% confidence
- Episode 2: 81% confidence
- Episode 3: 73% confidence

Plus aggregate uncertainty: [0.73, 0.92] confidence interval.

---

**Tweet 5/10** (The Evidence Problem)

SQL EXPLAIN tells you HOW the query ran:
- Seq scan
- 5 rows matched
- 3 filtered out

RECALL evidence tells you WHY results returned:
- Base confidence: 0.9
- Temporal decay: -0.13 (3 days old)
- Retrieval ambiguity: 5 similar nodes
- Calibrated: 0.77

Performance vs correctness introspection.

---

**Tweet 6/10** (Performance Deep Dive)

SQL optimized for:
- B-tree lookups
- Hash joins
- Sequential scans

RECALL optimized for:
- K-NN search (HNSW)
- Graph traversal
- Probabilistic ranking

Different access patterns = different algorithms = different performance profiles.

RECALL K-NN: 100μs. SQL pgvector: 500μs-2ms.

---

**Tweet 7/10** (Real Example)

Find high-confidence meetings about a project from the past month.

SQL: 200+ character query with manual decay calculation, subqueries, and mixed string/semantic search.

RECALL:
```
RECALL episode
WHERE type = "meeting"
  AND created > "2024-09-24"
  AND content SIMILAR TO project_embedding
  AND confidence > 0.7
```

Same semantics, clearer intent, 2x faster.

---

**Tweet 8/10** (The Cognitive Difference)

SQL was designed for DATA RETRIEVAL:
- Data is ground truth
- Queries find facts
- Results are deterministic
- Correctness = matches predicate

RECALL was designed for MEMORY RETRIEVAL:
- Memory is reconstruction
- Queries find likely experiences
- Results are probabilistic
- Correctness = reflects confidence

---

**Tweet 9/10** (When to Use Each)

Use SQL when:
- Relational data (users, orders, products)
- Transactional guarantees (ACID)
- Querying facts
- Naturally tabular

Use RECALL when:
- Episodic memory (events, experiences)
- Probabilistic results
- Querying semantics
- Naturally graph-based

For Engram: PostgreSQL for metadata, RECALL for cognitive queries.

---

**Tweet 10/10** (The Future)

RECALL is just the start. Coming next:

SPREAD - Spreading activation
PREDICT - Temporal prediction
IMAGINE - Pattern completion
CONSOLIDATE - Episodic-to-semantic transfer

None map cleanly to SQL primitives. They're cognitive operations that need cognitive semantics.

The future of AI query languages.

## Engagement Prompts

**Reply tweet** (Personal story):

When we first prototyped RECALL, I tried building it on PostgreSQL with pgvector.

It worked! Kind of.

But every feature felt like fighting the abstractions. Temporal decay? Stored procedure. Evidence chains? JSON columns. Confidence intervals? Application code.

The day we switched to native cognitive operations, query complexity dropped 70% and performance doubled.

Sometimes the right abstraction makes all the difference.

---

**Reply tweet** (Technical detail):

One subtle thing about RECALL vs SELECT: lock-free concurrency.

SQL uses MVCC with locks (even if optimistic). RECALL uses lock-free data structures:
- DashMap for episodes
- Immutable HNSW for embeddings
- Atomic version tracking

Result: Wait-free reads during consolidation. Massive concurrency win for cognitive workloads.

---

**Reply tweet** (Comparison):

For those asking "why not just use vector databases like Pinecone/Weaviate?"

They solve embedding similarity brilliantly. But they don't have:
- Temporal decay built-in
- Confidence calibration
- Evidence chains
- Spreading activation integration

RECALL isn't just K-NN search. It's a cognitive operation with memory semantics baked in.

---

**Reply tweet** (Open source):

RECALL is open source in Engram:
https://github.com/engram-memory/engram

Implementation: /engram-core/src/query/executor/recall.rs
Examples: /examples/query_examples.rs
Docs: /docs/reference/query-language.md

PRs welcome. Especially interested in:
- Alternative decay functions
- Calibration methods
- Evidence visualization

---

**Reply tweet** (Benchmarks):

Benchmark: 10k RECALL queries/sec on 4-core laptop (M2 MacBook Pro).

Key optimizations:
- HNSW index: O(log N) K-NN search
- Arena allocation: Zero-copy AST
- Lock-free reads: DashMap + immutable index
- Cache-optimal: Hot embeddings in L3

SQL equivalent (pgvector): 2k queries/sec on same hardware.

Details: /docs/performance/recall-benchmarks.md

**Reply tweet** (Call to action):

If you're building AI systems with memory, I'd love to hear:

What's your current approach?
- SQL with vector extensions?
- Document stores with embeddings?
- Custom implementations?

What's the biggest pain point with querying episodic memory?

Trying to understand what cognitive query abstractions would help most.
