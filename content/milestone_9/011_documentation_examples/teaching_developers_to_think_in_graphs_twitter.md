# Twitter Thread: Teaching Developers to Think in Graphs

**Tweet 1/5**

Documentation isn't about what YOU know. It's about what THEY need to learn.

SQL developers think: Tables + JOINs
Graph developers think: Nodes + Edges

Teaching the shift without overwhelming. Here's how.

Diátaxis framework: 4 doc types, 4 purposes

1. Tutorials: Learning (get something working)
2. How-To: Problem-solving (fix specific issue)
3. Explanation: Understanding (mental models)
4. Reference: Information (look up syntax)

Mixing them confuses. Separate them clarifies.

Progressive disclosure: Simple → Complex

Level 1: RECALL episode (success!)
Level 2: WHERE confidence > 0.7 (constraints)
Level 3: SIMILAR TO embedding (semantic search)
Level 4: THEN SPREAD (composition)

Each builds on previous. Don't dump full syntax upfront.

Concrete > Abstract

Bad: "SPREAD implements exponential decay"
Good: "Think 'coffee' → 'morning' (0.86 strong), 'dinner' (0.12 weak)"

Everyday analogies + specific numbers + code.

Works every time.

Interactive playgrounds: Learning by doing

Online editor + pre-loaded data + instant feedback

10x more engagement than static docs.

Developers learn by trying, not just reading.
