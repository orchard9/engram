# Twitter Thread: Error Messages That Teach

**Tweet 1/10** (Hook)

It's 3am. Production is down. You're staring at:

"Parse error at position 12"

vs

"Unknown keyword 'RECAL'. Did you mean 'RECALL'?"

Which error message do you want?

Let's talk about why error messages are a primary interface, not an afterthought.

---

**Tweet 2/10** (The Problem)

Most parsers give terrible error messages:
- "Syntax error" (what syntax?)
- "Unexpected token" (why unexpected?)
- "Invalid input" (how do I fix it?)

These fail the "tiredness test": Would a stressed developer at 3am understand what to do?

Usually no.

---

**Tweet 3/10** (Five Principles)

Good error messages have 5 qualities:

1. Precision: Line & column number
2. Clarity: What's wrong (found vs expected)
3. Actionability: How to fix it
4. Context: Grammar-aware suggestions
5. Intelligence: Catch typos automatically

Let's break each down.

---

**Tweet 4/10** (Typo Detection)

The secret weapon: Levenshtein distance

"RECAL" → "RECALL" = 1 edit
"SPRED" → "SPREAD" = 1 edit
"IMAGIN" → "IMAGINE" = 1 edit

Algorithm compares your input to known keywords, suggests closest match if distance ≤2.

Cost: ~1.5μs for 10 keywords. Worth it.

---

**Tweet 5/10** (Context Matters)

Generic error: "Expected identifier"

Context-aware error: "SPREAD requires FROM keyword followed by node identifier. Example: SPREAD FROM node_123"

Parser tracks state (QueryStart, AfterSpread, InConstraints). State determines what's valid next.

Context = compressed domain knowledge.

---

**Tweet 6/10** (Real Example)

Query: "SPREAD node_123"

Bad:
```
Error: Expected FROM at position 7
```

Good:
```
Parse error at line 1, column 8:
  Found: 'node_123'
  Expected: FROM keyword

Suggestion: SPREAD requires FROM keyword
Example: SPREAD FROM node_123 MAX_HOPS 5
```

Which helps you fix it faster?

---

**Tweet 7/10** (Architecture)

Good error messages require architecture:

Layer 1: Detection (parser identifies error)
Layer 2: Enrichment (add context, suggestions, examples)
Layer 3: Presentation (format for humans)

Each layer independently testable. Separation of concerns.

Not an afterthought.

---

**Tweet 8/10** (Performance)

"Won't this slow down parsing?"

No. Hot path (valid queries) vs error path (invalid queries):

Hot path: <100μs, zero allocations
Error path: <1ms, allocations OK

Developers see errors 1% of the time. Spending 1ms to save 30s of debugging is worth it.

---

**Tweet 9/10** (Testing)

How do we ensure quality? Comprehensive testing:

- 75+ invalid query test cases
- Each tests: position accuracy, typo detection, context suggestions
- Property test: ALL errors have suggestion + example
- Regression test: error quality doesn't degrade

Error messages are first-class.

---

**Tweet 10/10** (Conclusion)

Error messages are not a secondary concern. They're a primary interface between your system and its users.

Good error messages:
- Reduce debugging time (seconds, not minutes)
- Teach through examples
- Build confidence
- Lower support costs

Invest accordingly.

At 3am, your users will thank you.

**Bonus Tweet** (Metrics)

How do we measure success?

Quantitative:
- 100% of errors have suggestion + example
- Position accuracy ±1 char
- Error construction <1ms

Qualitative:
- All errors pass "tiredness test"
- No parser jargon

User-facing:
- >80% errors fixed on first try

**Thread Summary** (Pin Tweet)

New blog post: "Error Messages That Teach: Why 'Did You Mean RECALL?' Beats 'Syntax Error'"

Covers:
- The 5 principles of good error messages
- Levenshtein distance for typo detection
- Context-aware suggestions
- Architecture & testing
- Performance trade-offs

**Behind-the-Scenes Tweet**

Fun fact: Computing Levenshtein distance for "RECAL" vs all 10 Engram keywords takes 1.5 microseconds.

That's 0.0000015 seconds.

On the error path (1% of queries), that's totally acceptable overhead for dramatically better UX.

Micro-optimizations matter, but so does human time.

---

**Code Example Tweet**

Here's the typo detection code:

```rust
pub fn find_closest_keyword(
    input: &str,
    keywords: &[&str]
) -> Option<String> {
    let mut closest = None;
    let mut min_dist = usize::MAX;

    for keyword in keywords {
        let dist = levenshtein_distance(
            input, keyword
        );

        // Only suggest if distance ≤2
        if dist <= 2 && dist < min_dist {
            min_dist = dist;
            closest = Some(*keyword);
        }
    }

    closest
}
```

150ns per comparison.

**Comparison Tweet**

Error message quality spectrum:

Python:
"SyntaxError: invalid syntax"

Generic parser:
"Error: Unexpected token at line 3"

Rust:
"error[E0425]: cannot find value `x`
help: a variable with similar name exists: `y`"

Elm:
[multi-line formatted error with visual highlighting and hint]

Engram: Targeting Rust/Elm tier.

---

**Learning Tweet**

Error messages as teaching tool:

Episodic memory: "That time I typed RECAL and parser caught it"

Semantic memory: After 3-4 corrections, you learn "parser catches typos"

Pattern completion: See example, brain extrapolates grammar

Good errors accelerate learning.

---

**Performance Tweet**

Hot path vs error path trade-offs:

Valid query parse:
- Target: <100μs
- Zero allocations
- String slices only
- 99% of queries

Invalid query error:
- Target: <1ms (10x slower OK)
- Allocations allowed
- Levenshtein distance OK
- 1% of queries

Optimize for the common case.

---

**Testing Strategy Tweet**

How we test error quality:

```rust
#[test]
fn typo_detection_works() {
    let cases = vec![
        ("RECAL", "RECALL"),
        ("SPRED", "SPREAD"),
    ];

    for (typo, expected) in cases {
        let err = Parser::parse(typo)
            .unwrap_err();

        assert!(err.contains("Did you mean"));
        assert!(err.contains(expected));
    }
}
```

Test the UX, not just the parser.

**Philosophy Tweet**

Joe Armstrong (Erlang): Good error messages pass the "3am test"

Would a tired, stressed developer understand what to do?

Design principle: Minimize cognitive load
- No parser jargon
- Clear next step
- Show, don't just tell

Error messages are UX.

---

**Impact Tweet**

ROI of good error messages:

Investment:
- Architecture (3 layers)
- Typo detection (Levenshtein)
- Testing (75+ cases)
- Examples (context-specific)

Payoff:
- 3x faster debugging
- 80% errors fixed on first try
- Lower support tickets
- Higher developer confidence

Worth it.

---

**Call-to-Action Tweet**

Building a parser? Design error messages as first-class features:

1. Track position (line, column)
2. Detect typos (Levenshtein ≤2)
3. Provide context-aware suggestions
4. Include examples
5. Test comprehensively

Your 3am self will thank you.

What's the best/worst error message you've seen?

---

**Engineering Trade-offs Tweet**

Why hand-written parser instead of parser generator?

Parser generators:
+ Less manual work
- Generic error messages
- Harder to customize
- Extra dependency

Hand-written:
+ Full control over errors
+ Precise error recovery
+ No generated code
- More upfront work

For UX-critical parsers, hand-written wins.

---

**Accessibility Tweet**

Error messages are an accessibility concern.

Cognitive load varies:
- Time of day (3am vs 2pm)
- Stress level (production down vs exploratory)
- Experience (novice vs expert)
- Context switching (coming from different system)

Design for worst-case: tired novice under pressure.

---

**Meta Tweet**

Writing this thread made me realize: error messages are compressed teaching.

Every error is an opportunity to:
- Correct the immediate issue
- Teach the grammar rule
- Build confidence in the system
- Reduce future errors

Don't waste that opportunity with "syntax error".

---

**Industry Examples Tweet**

Languages with great error messages:
- Elm (gold standard)
- Rust (excellent)
- TypeScript (good)
- Clang (good with fix-it hints)

Languages with poor error messages:
- Python (minimal)
- PHP (cryptic)
- Many parser generators (generic)

Learn from the good ones.

---

**Metrics Tweet**

How Engram measures error message success:

Ship metrics:
- 100% have suggestion + example
- Position accurate ±1 char
- Typo detection for all keywords

Runtime metrics:
- % errors fixed first try
- Time to fix (before/after)
- Support tickets re: errors

Both matter.

---

**Final Thought Tweet**

Error messages are not about being "nice" to developers.

They're about:
- Reducing debugging time
- Accelerating learning
- Building system confidence
- Lowering operational cost

Good error messages are a competitive advantage.

Treat them as first-class features.
