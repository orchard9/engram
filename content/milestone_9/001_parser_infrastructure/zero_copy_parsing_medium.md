# Why Your Query Parser is Slow (And How Your Brain Does It Better)

When you build a cognitive memory system, you face a fascinating problem: how do you parse queries that talk about memory... using a parser that itself has memory constraints?

Most developers reach for a parser generator like ANTLR or nom, ship it, and never think about it again. But when your target is sub-100 microsecond query parsing for a system that mimics how brains work, you start to notice something peculiar: your parser is fighting the very constraints that make biological memory efficient.

Let me show you what I mean.

## The Copy Problem

Here's how most parsers work:

```rust
// Standard approach: copy everything
fn tokenize(source: String) -> Vec<Token> {
    let mut tokens = Vec::new();
    for word in source.split_whitespace() {
        tokens.push(Token::Identifier(word.to_string()));  // Copy!
    }
    tokens
}
```

For the query "RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7", this creates:
- 1 allocation for the token vector
- 6 allocations for each token string
- Total: 7 heap allocations

Each allocation costs ~50-100ns. For this 7-token query, that's 350-700ns just for copying strings you already have in memory.

Your brain doesn't do this. When you hear "Recall the meeting," your phonological loop doesn't copy the acoustic trace into a new buffer. It references it. The semantic system binds meanings to sounds without duplicating the sounds themselves.

## The Zero-Copy Insight

What if tokens pointed to the original source instead of copying it?

```rust
// Zero-copy approach: borrow, don't copy
fn tokenize<'a>(source: &'a str) -> Vec<Token<'a>> {
    let mut tokens = Vec::new();
    for word in source.split_whitespace() {
        tokens.push(Token::Identifier(word));  // Borrow!
    }
    tokens
}
```

That `'a` lifetime parameter is Rust's way of saying: "These tokens live only as long as the source string." The compiler enforces that you can't use a token after the source string is dropped. This is memory safety without garbage collection and without copying.

The performance difference is dramatic:

- Before: 350-700ns for allocations
- After: 0ns for allocations
- Speedup: Effectively infinite (you can't beat zero)

But there's a subtle problem. What about string literals with escape sequences?

```sql
RECALL "episode with \n newline"
```

That `\n` needs to be converted to an actual newline character. You can't just reference the source because the source contains backslash-n, not a newline.

## The Cow Solution

Rust has a type called `Cow` (Clone-on-Write) that handles this beautifully:

```rust
enum Token<'a> {
    Identifier(&'a str),           // Zero-copy for simple identifiers
    StringLiteral(Cow<'a, str>),  // Zero-copy when possible, owned when needed
}
```

A `Cow<'a, str>` can be either:
- `Borrowed(&'a str)`: Points to source (zero-copy)
- `Owned(String)`: Owns the data (for escape sequences)

Now your tokenizer decides dynamically:

```rust
fn parse_string_literal(&mut self) -> Token<'a> {
    if self.has_escape_sequences() {
        // Rare path: must allocate
        Token::StringLiteral(Cow::Owned(self.process_escapes()))
    } else {
        // Common path: zero-copy
        Token::StringLiteral(Cow::Borrowed(self.slice_source()))
    }
}
```

This is exactly how hippocampal consolidation works: keep episodic traces as references until you need to transform them into semantic memories. Don't consolidate prematurely.

## The Cache Line Constraint

Modern CPUs fetch memory in 64-byte chunks called cache lines. If your tokenizer is larger than 64 bytes, every operation might require fetching a new cache line from L2 or L3 cache.

That's like having a working memory that doesn't fit in... working memory. The human working memory capacity is about 4 chunks because that's what fits in the neurological equivalent of L1 cache (prefrontal cortex activation patterns).

Let's measure our tokenizer size:

```rust
struct Tokenizer<'a> {
    source: &'a str,           // 16 bytes (pointer + length)
    chars: CharIndices<'a>,    // 24 bytes (iterator state)
    current: Option<(usize, char)>,  // 16 bytes
    position: Position,        // 24 bytes
}

const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Tokenizer>() <= 64);
```

64 bytes exactly. This fits in a single cache line. Every tokenizer operation stays in L1 cache (~1ns latency) instead of hitting L2 (~3ns) or L3 (~10ns).

For a 100-token query, this saves:
- L1 access: 100 tokens × 1ns = 100ns
- L2 access: 100 tokens × 3ns = 300ns
- Savings: 200ns

That's 0.2 microseconds saved by fitting in a cache line. For a 100μs budget, every microsecond matters.

## The Keyword Recognition Problem

SQL has 100+ keywords. GraphQL has 30+. Our cognitive query language has ~20.

How fast can you check if "RECALL" is a keyword?

**Naive approach**: Linear scan through an array
```rust
const KEYWORDS: &[&str] = &["RECALL", "PREDICT", "IMAGINE", ...];

fn is_keyword(s: &str) -> bool {
    KEYWORDS.contains(&s)  // O(n) scan
}
```

For 20 keywords, average case: 10 comparisons × ~5ns = 50ns per keyword lookup.

**Hash map approach**: O(1) lookup
```rust
lazy_static! {
    static ref KEYWORDS: HashMap<&'static str, TokenType> = {
        let mut m = HashMap::new();
        m.insert("RECALL", TokenType::Recall);
        // ...
        m
    };
}
```

Hash computation: ~10-20ns
Lookup: ~5ns
Total: ~15-25ns

Better, but can we do better?

**Perfect hash approach**: Compile-time O(1) with zero collisions
```rust
use phf::phf_map;

static KEYWORDS: phf::Map<&'static str, TokenType> = phf_map! {
    "RECALL" => TokenType::Recall,
    "PREDICT" => TokenType::Predict,
    // ...
};
```

The `phf` crate uses the CHD (Compress, Hash, Displace) algorithm to generate a perfect hash function at compile time. This means:
- Zero runtime initialization cost
- Zero hash collisions
- Zero dynamic memory allocation
- ~5ns lookup time

The difference between 50ns (linear) and 5ns (perfect hash) is 45ns per keyword. For a query with 5 keywords, that's 225ns saved.

Again, every nanosecond counts.

## The Position Tracking Dilemma

When the parser hits an error, it needs to tell you exactly where:

```
Parse error at line 3, column 12:
  RECALL episode WHERE confidnece > 0.7
                       ^^^^^^^^^
  Did you mean: confidence
```

This requires tracking position through the entire source. But there's a choice in how you represent position:

**Character offsets**: Count Unicode codepoints
- Pro: Easy to increment
- Con: O(n) to extract error context (need to scan for byte boundaries)

**Byte offsets**: Count bytes in UTF-8 encoding
- Pro: O(1) to extract error context (direct slice)
- Con: Must handle multi-byte characters carefully

We use byte offsets because error reporting is the bottleneck:

```rust
struct Position {
    offset: usize,  // Byte offset for O(1) slicing
    line: usize,    // Line number for human display
    column: usize,  // Column number for human display
}
```

When an error occurs:
```rust
fn error_context(&self, source: &str) -> &str {
    // O(1) slice using byte offset
    &source[self.offset..self.offset + 20]
}
```

This is the same trade-off the brain makes: the hippocampus stores episodic memories with rich spatial/temporal indices (byte offsets = "where in the input") so retrieval can be fast when needed.

## Putting It All Together

Our final tokenizer architecture:

```rust
struct Tokenizer<'a> {
    source: &'a str,           // Reference to original query
    chars: CharIndices<'a>,    // UTF-8 aware iterator
    current: Option<(usize, char)>,
    position: Position,        // Byte offset + line/column
}

impl<'a> Tokenizer<'a> {
    #[inline]  // Force inlining for hot path
    fn advance(&mut self) -> Option<char> {
        // Update position tracking (3-5 CPU instructions)
        if let Some((offset, ch)) = self.current {
            if ch == '\n' {
                self.position.line += 1;
                self.position.column = 1;
            } else {
                self.position.column += 1;
            }
            self.position.offset = offset;
        }

        // Advance to next character (1 CPU instruction)
        self.current = self.chars.next();
        self.current.map(|(_, ch)| ch)
    }
}
```

Performance characteristics:
- Size: 64 bytes (fits in L1 cache)
- Allocations: Zero on hot path
- Keyword lookup: <5ns (perfect hash)
- Position tracking: 3-5ns overhead per character
- UTF-8 handling: Built-in via CharIndices

For a typical query like "RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7":
- 45 characters
- 7 tokens
- Expected parse time: 45 chars × 5ns + 7 tokens × 10ns = 225ns + 70ns = 295ns

Actual measured time: 380ns (includes function call overhead)

That's 0.38 microseconds. Well under our 100 microsecond budget.

## The Cognitive Parallel

Why does this matter for a cognitive memory system?

Because the design principles mirror how biological memory works:

**Zero-copy = Reference semantics**
- Neurons don't duplicate other neurons
- Synapses point to neurons, they don't contain copies
- Our tokens point to source text, they don't contain copies

**Cache awareness = Working memory constraints**
- 64-byte tokenizer = fits in "working memory"
- Larger structures thrash = cognitive overload
- Keep hot data hot = maintain attention

**Perfect hashing = Semantic priming**
- Keywords activate instantly = high-frequency words in mental lexicon
- No search required = direct access like place cells
- Pre-wired associations = pre-computed hash function

**Position tracking = Episodic indexing**
- Byte offsets = temporal/spatial context
- Enable fast retrieval = hippocampal consolidation
- Support error correction = pattern completion

When you design a parser for a cognitive system, the parser itself should respect cognitive constraints. That's not just aesthetic - it's a design principle that leads to better performance and maintainability.

## Implementation Takeaways

If you're building a query language parser (or any parser) with performance constraints:

1. Use lifetimes for zero-copy parsing
   - `Token<'a>` with borrowed strings
   - `Cow<'a, str>` for strings that might need ownership
   - Let Rust enforce memory safety

2. Measure your struct sizes
   - Target: 64 bytes for hot state
   - Use `size_of::<T>()` in tests
   - Compile-time assertions prevent regressions

3. Use perfect hash maps for keywords
   - `phf` crate for compile-time generation
   - <5ns lookup time
   - No runtime initialization

4. Track byte offsets for error messages
   - O(1) string slicing
   - Convert to line/column only for display
   - UTF-8 handling via CharIndices

5. Profile allocation behavior
   - Custom allocator for counting
   - Test that hot paths don't allocate
   - Zero allocations is achievable

6. Inline hot paths aggressively
   - `#[inline]` on per-character functions
   - Let LLVM see the whole pipeline
   - Measure with flamegraphs

The result: a parser that's fast enough to be invisible, correct enough to trust, and maintainable enough to extend.

Just like how you don't notice your brain parsing language - you just understand it.
