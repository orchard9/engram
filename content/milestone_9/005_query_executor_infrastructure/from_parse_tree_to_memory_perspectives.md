# Perspectives: From Parse Tree to Memory

## Cognitive Architecture Perspective

### Query Execution as Thought Process

When a cognitive system processes a query like "RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7", it mirrors how human memory works:

**1. Intention Recognition** (Parser → AST)
- Natural language: "Remember that thing I'm pretty sure about"
- Formal syntax: RECALL + confidence constraint
- AST: Structured representation of recall intention

**2. Memory Cue Formation** (AST → Cue)
- Pattern → Memory cue
- Constraints → Filtering criteria
- Like how "think about coffee" activates coffee-related memories

**3. Retrieval Process** (Cue → Episodes)
- MemoryStore.recall() = hippocampal pattern completion
- Confidence threshold = metacognitive filtering
- "Only return memories I'm confident about"

**4. Result Integration** (Episodes → Result)
- Evidence chain = explaining the thought process
- "I remembered X because it was activated via Y"
- Metacognition: knowing how you know

**Key Insight**: Query executor is implementing computational metacognition - the system explaining its own cognitive process.

## Memory Systems Perspective

### Multi-Tenant Memory Spaces as Isolated Episodic Stores

**Biological Analogy**: Each person has their own episodic memory
- You can't accidentally recall someone else's memories
- Memory consolidation happens within your own brain
- No cross-contamination between individuals

**Engram Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct QueryContext {
    pub memory_space_id: MemorySpaceId, // Like "whose brain?"
    // ...
}
```

Every query asks: "In whose memory space should I search?"

**Why This Matters**:
- Multi-tenant systems: User A's memories isolated from User B
- Safety: Can't leak memories across boundaries
- Performance: No global locks, parallel queries across spaces

**Contrast with SQL**:
```sql
-- SQL: Filter by user_id (runtime check)
SELECT * FROM memories WHERE user_id = 'user_123';

-- Risk: Forgot WHERE clause? Leaks all memories!
SELECT * FROM memories; -- OOPS
```

**Engram**: Compile-time enforcement
```rust
// MUST provide memory_space_id
executor.execute(query, QueryContext {
    memory_space_id: /* required */
});
// Forgot it? Compiler error!
```

**Analogy**: Like asking "whose memories?" is mandatory, not optional.

## Rust Graph Engine Perspective

### Zero-Cost Abstractions for Query Dispatch

**Pattern Matching as Dispatch Mechanism**:
```rust
match query {
    Query::Recall(q) => self.execute_recall(q, space, ctx),
    Query::Spread(q) => self.execute_spread(q, space, ctx),
    // ... compile-time dispatch
}
```

**Why This Outperforms Virtual Dispatch**:

**Virtual dispatch (trait objects)**:
```rust
trait QueryStrategy {
    fn execute(&self) -> Result<QueryResult>;
}

// Runtime cost: vtable lookup + indirect jump
let strategy: Box<dyn QueryStrategy> = /* ... */;
strategy.execute(); // ~10ns overhead
```

**Pattern matching (Engram)**:
```rust
// Compile-time dispatch: direct function call
match query {
    Query::Recall(q) => execute_recall(q), // ~0ns overhead
}
```

**Performance**: Pattern matching is zero-cost abstraction
- No vtable
- No heap allocation
- Inlined at call site
- Same as if-else chain, but type-safe

**Key Insight**: Rust's enum + pattern matching = best of both worlds (safety + performance).

## Systems Architecture Perspective

### Query Executor as Translation Layer

**Three-Layer Cake**:

**Layer 1: Syntax (Parser)**
```
RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7
↓
RecallQuery { pattern, constraints }
```

**Layer 2: Semantics (Executor)**
```rust
RecallQuery
↓ pattern_to_cue()
Cue::Content("episode")
↓ apply_constraints()
ConfidenceThreshold(0.7)
↓ MemoryStore::recall()
Vec<Episode>
```

**Layer 3: Operations (Engine)**
```
MemoryStore::recall(cue)
↓ SIMDMatrixOps (from M1)
↓ ProbabilisticQueryExecutor (from M6)
↓ ProbabilisticQueryResult
```

**Design Principle**: Each layer talks to the next via well-defined interfaces
- Parser doesn't know about MemoryStore
- Executor doesn't know about SIMD operations
- Engine doesn't know about query syntax

**Benefits**:
- **Testability**: Mock each layer independently
- **Swappability**: Replace parser without touching engine
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries, no spaghetti

## Synthesis: Evidence Chains as Cognitive Audit Trail

### Why Evidence Matters

**Debugging Example**:
```
Query: "RECALL meeting_notes WHERE confidence > 0.8"
Result: Empty

WHY? Evidence chain shows:
1. Query parsed: RecallQuery { pattern: "meeting_notes", confidence_threshold: 0.8 }
2. MemoryStore.recall(): Found 5 episodes
3. Confidence filtering: 5 episodes had confidence 0.6-0.75
4. Result: 0 episodes (all filtered out)

Fix: Lower threshold to 0.6
```

Without evidence: "Why didn't it find anything?" (mystery)
With evidence: "Found episodes, but confidence too low" (actionable)

**Compliance Example**:
```
Audit question: "How did system decide to recommend episode X?"

Evidence chain:
1. Query: SPREAD FROM user_input MAX_HOPS 3
2. Activation: user_input → related_concept (strength 0.9)
3. Activation: related_concept → episode_X (strength 0.7)
4. Path: user_input → related_concept → episode_X
5. Result: episode_X (total activation: 0.63)

Explanation: "Found via 2-hop spreading activation, total strength 0.63"
```

**Key Insight**: Evidence chains transform black-box into glass-box. Users understand WHY results returned.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Multi-tenant enforcement**: Compile-time requirement for memory_space_id
2. **Evidence construction**: Every query operation adds to evidence chain
3. **Timeout checks**: Deadline at operation boundaries
4. **Error context**: Preserve QueryContext in all errors

### Medium Priority
1. **Metrics**: Query latency, memory space usage, timeout frequency
2. **Caching**: Parsed query results (if same query repeated)
3. **Rate limiting**: Per-memory-space query quotas
4. **Audit logs**: All queries logged with evidence

### Low Priority
1. **Query optimization**: AST rewriting for performance (future milestone)
2. **Parallel execution**: Run independent operations concurrently
3. **Streaming results**: Large result sets streamed, not materialized
4. **Query explain**: EXPLAIN mode showing execution plan (like SQL)

---

## Conclusion

Query executor is the bridge between syntax and semantics, between what users ask and what the engine does. Good design here means:

1. **Clear boundaries**: Parser → Executor → Engine (no shortcuts)
2. **Safety by default**: Multi-tenant isolation compile-time enforced
3. **Explainability**: Evidence chains show the "why"
4. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions where possible, overhead only on error path

The goal: Make cognitive queries feel natural while maintaining the precision and safety of a well-engineered system.
