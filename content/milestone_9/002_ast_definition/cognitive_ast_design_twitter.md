# Twitter Thread: Type-State ASTs for Cognitive Query Languages

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your query parser lets you write this:

```rust
RECALL WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

"Recall what? You forgot the pattern!"

Caught at runtime. 3am. Production. Users waiting.

What if the compiler caught this at compile time? Thread on type-state programming for cognitive systems.

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Traditional AST:

```rust
struct RecallQuery {
    pattern: Option<Pattern>,  // Maybe has pattern?
}
```

"Optional" means it's valid to have no pattern. But RECALL requires a pattern. We've created a "representable but invalid" state.

Now you need runtime validation. Every. Single. Time.

## Tweet 3 (Type-State Solution)
Use phantom types to track state:

```rust
struct Builder<State> {
    pattern: Option<Pattern>,
    _phantom: PhantomData<State>,
}

struct NoPattern;
struct WithPattern;
```

State exists only at compile time. Zero runtime cost.

## Tweet 4 (State Transitions)
```rust
impl Builder<NoPattern> {
    fn pattern(self, p: Pattern) -> Builder<WithPattern> {
        // Transition to WithPattern state
    }
    // No build() method!
}

impl Builder<WithPattern> {
    fn build(self) -> RecallQuery {
        // Can only build after pattern is set
    }
}
```

Compiler enforces the state machine.

## Tweet 5 (Compile-Time Enforcement)
This won't compile:

```rust
Builder::new()
    .build()  // ERROR: method not found on Builder<NoPattern>
```

This will:

```rust
Builder::new()
    .pattern(...)  // Transitions to WithPattern
    .build()       // OK!
```

Type errors instead of runtime errors. Shift left on bug detection.

## Tweet 6 (Zero-Cost Abstraction)
"But doesn't PhantomData add overhead?"

No.

```rust
size_of::<Builder<NoPattern>>() == size_of::<Builder<WithPattern>>()
```

State parameter is erased at compile time. You get compile-time checks without runtime cost.

This is zero-cost abstraction in action.

## Tweet 7 (The Cognitive Parallel)
Your hippocampus follows a state machine:

1. Cue received ("Where did I park?")
2. Search episodic memory
3. Retrieve candidate
4. Assess confidence

You can't skip states. Can't assess confidence before retrieval.

Type-state builders mirror this biological ordering.

## Tweet 8 (Memory Layout Trade-offs)
Rust enums: size = discriminant + max(variant_sizes)

```rust
enum Query {
    Recall(RecallQuery),  // 120 bytes
    Spread(SpreadQuery),  // 64 bytes
}
```

Size = 128 bytes. Even tiny Spread queries occupy 128 bytes.

Alternative: Box large variants (8 bytes ptr vs. 120 bytes inline).

## Tweet 9 (Inline vs. Boxed)
Inline: 128 bytes, zero indirection
Boxed: 72 bytes, one pointer dereference

Which wins? Depends on access pattern:
- Parse once, validate once: Inline (data contiguous)
- Traverse repeatedly: Boxing might win (smaller)

We chose inline. Measured impact: ~20ns saved per query.

## Tweet 10 (Lifetime-Parameterized ASTs)
Extend zero-copy from tokens to AST:

```rust
struct RecallQuery<'a> {
    pattern: Pattern<'a>,  // Borrows from source
}

enum Query<'a> {
    Recall(RecallQuery<'a>),
}
```

Parse "RECALL episode" with zero allocations. "episode" is a slice into source string.

## Tweet 11 (The Lifetime Trade-off)
Pro: Zero allocations during parsing (2-3x faster)
Con: Lifetimes propagate everywhere

```rust
fn parse<'a>(source: &'a str) -> Query<'a>
fn execute<'a>(query: Query<'a>) -> Result
fn cache<'a>(query: Query<'a>)  // Problem!
```

To store beyond source lifetime: clone with `into_owned()`.

One-time cost for storage, zero cost for parsing.

## Tweet 12 (Cognitive Operations)
Our query language has 5 operations:

RECALL: Episodic retrieval
SPREAD: Activation propagation
IMAGINE: Pattern completion
CONSOLIDATE: Episodic->semantic transfer
PREDICT: Temporal projection

Each maps to a biological memory process. AST isn't just syntax - it's a cognitive interface.

## Tweet 13 (Validation Philosophy)
When to validate?

Construction time: Clunky API (Result everywhere)
Parse time: Separation of concerns, better errors
Execution time: Can't execute invalid queries

We chose parse-time:
- One-time cost
- Error messages have source context
- Execution assumes valid input

## Tweet 14 (Size Constraints)
Human working memory: 7±2 chunks

RecallQuery fields:
- pattern (1 chunk)
- constraints (2-4 chunks)
- confidence (1 chunk)
- base_rate (1 chunk)
- limit (1 chunk)

Total: 5-7 chunks

If your AST doesn't fit in working memory, developers can't hold it "in mind" to debug.

## Tweet 15 (Performance Summary)
Final characteristics:

Parse time: <100μs
Memory: <256 bytes per AST
Allocations: 1-3 (just Vec for constraints)
Validation: Zero at runtime (compile-time + parse-time)
Type safety: Invalid states unrepresentable

Type-state gives you all this with zero runtime cost.

## Tweet 16 (The Implementation)
Key techniques:

1. PhantomData for state tracking
2. Cow<'a, str> for zero-copy
3. Inline storage for cache locality
4. Compile-time size assertions
5. Builder pattern for ergonomics

Each piece compounds. Result: 2-3x faster than traditional AST with better type safety.

## Tweet 17 (Real-World Example)
Type-state in the wild:

hyper::Client (TLS state)
tokio::net::TcpStream (connection state)
reqwest::RequestBuilder (method/URL state)

This isn't exotic - it's production-tested for years. We're applying it to cognitive query languages because invalid states hurt.

## Tweet 18 (The Lessons)
1. Make invalid states unrepresentable (type-state)
2. Measure struct sizes (<256 bytes target)
3. Use lifetimes for zero-copy (2-3x speedup)
4. Validate at boundaries (parse-time)
5. Design for working memory (5-7 fields max)

Performance + safety + ergonomics.

## Tweet 19 (The Aha Moment)
Traditional approach:
"Let's accept any AST, validate at runtime"

Type-state approach:
"Let's make the compiler prevent invalid ASTs"

The compiler is running anyway. Make it work for you. Shift validation from runtime to compile-time wherever possible.

## Tweet 20 (Call to Action)
If you're building:
- Query languages
- Configuration systems
- State machines
- APIs with ordering constraints

Consider type-state. The complexity is front-loaded (design time), but you get:
- Compile-time correctness
- Better IDE support
- Zero runtime overhead
- Users can't shoot themselves in the foot

Win-win-win-win.
