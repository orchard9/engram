# The AST Your Compiler Wishes You'd Write: Type-State for Cognitive Queries

Database query languages are 50 years old, and we're still building them the same way: parse SQL, hope for the best, discover problems at runtime.

What if your query language could prevent invalid queries from compiling? Not just syntax errors - semantic errors like "forgot to specify a retrieval pattern" or "confidence interval is backwards."

Welcome to type-state programming: using the compiler to enforce correctness at compile time instead of discovering bugs at 3am in production.

## The Problem with Traditional ASTs

Here's a typical query AST:

```rust
struct RecallQuery {
    pattern: Option<Pattern>,      // Maybe has a pattern?
    constraints: Vec<Constraint>,
    confidence_threshold: Option<ConfidenceThreshold>,
}
```

What's wrong with this? The `Option<Pattern>` means "pattern is optional." But in our query language, RECALL requires a pattern:

```sql
RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7  -- Valid
RECALL WHERE confidence > 0.7          -- Invalid: what am I recalling?
```

The type system says pattern is optional, but the semantics say it's required. We've created a "representable but invalid" state.

Now imagine the validation code:

```rust
impl RecallQuery {
    fn validate(&self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        if self.pattern.is_none() {
            return Err(Error::MissingPattern);
        }
        // ... 50 more lines of validation
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

This validation runs at runtime. If you forget to call it, you ship broken queries to production. If you call it repeatedly, you waste CPU cycles checking the same invariants.

There's a better way.

## Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

What if the type system made it impossible to construct a RecallQuery without a pattern?

```rust
struct RecallQuery {
    pattern: Pattern,  // Not optional - must be present!
    constraints: Vec<Constraint>,
    confidence_threshold: Option<ConfidenceThreshold>,
}
```

Now pattern is required at the type level. But how do we build this gradually?

```rust
let mut query = RecallQuery::new();  // Doesn't compile yet - no pattern!
query.set_pattern(Pattern::NodeId("episode"));
query.add_constraint(Constraint::ConfidenceAbove(0.7));
```

The problem: `RecallQuery::new()` can't return a valid query if pattern is required. We need an intermediate state.

## Enter Type-State Programming

Type-state uses phantom type parameters to track what state an object is in:

```rust
struct RecallQueryBuilder<State> {
    pattern: Option<Pattern>,
    constraints: Vec<Constraint>,
    _phantom: PhantomData<State>,
}

// State tags (zero-size types)
struct NoPattern;
struct WithPattern;
```

Now we can have different APIs for different states:

```rust
impl RecallQueryBuilder<NoPattern> {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            pattern: None,
            constraints: Vec::new(),
            _phantom: PhantomData,
        }
    }

    // Setting pattern transitions state
    fn pattern(mut self, p: Pattern) -> RecallQueryBuilder<WithPattern> {
        self.pattern = Some(p);
        RecallQueryBuilder {
            pattern: self.pattern,
            constraints: self.constraints,
            _phantom: PhantomData,  // Now in WithPattern state!
        }
    }

    // Can't build without pattern
    // (no build() method on NoPattern state)
}

impl RecallQueryBuilder<WithPattern> {
    // Can add constraints in either state
    fn constraint(mut self, c: Constraint) -> Self {
        self.constraints.push(c);
        self
    }

    // Can only build once pattern is set
    fn build(self) -> RecallQuery {
        RecallQuery {
            pattern: self.pattern.unwrap(),  // Safe: guaranteed by type state
            constraints: self.constraints,
            confidence_threshold: None,
        }
    }
}
```

Now look what happens at compile time:

```rust
// Won't compile - no build() method on NoPattern
let query = RecallQueryBuilder::new()
    .constraint(...)
    .build();  // ERROR: method not found in `RecallQueryBuilder<NoPattern>`

// Compiles - pattern sets the state to WithPattern
let query = RecallQueryBuilder::new()
    .pattern(Pattern::NodeId("episode"))
    .constraint(Constraint::ConfidenceAbove(0.7))
    .build();  // OK: build() exists on WithPattern
```

The compiler enforces the state machine: you must set a pattern before building. No runtime validation needed.

## The Cognitive Parallel

Why is this called "type-state"? Because it mirrors state machines in hardware and cognitive systems.

When you recall a memory, your brain follows a state machine:

1. **Cue state**: Received a retrieval cue ("Where did I park?")
2. **Search state**: Hippocampus searches episodic memory
3. **Retrieval state**: Found a candidate memory
4. **Confidence state**: Assess confidence in retrieved memory

You can't skip states. You can't assess confidence before retrieving. The biological system enforces an order.

Type-state builders enforce the same ordering at compile time:

```rust
RecallQueryBuilder::new()          // Cue state (no pattern yet)
    .pattern(...)                  // Search state (pattern provided)
    .constraint(...)               // Refinement state (narrow search)
    .build()                       // Retrieval state (execute query)
```

Just as your hippocampus won't attempt retrieval without a cue, the compiler won't let you build a query without a pattern.

## Zero-Cost Abstractions

"But doesn't all this type machinery add overhead?"

No. Here's the beautiful part: `PhantomData<State>` is a zero-size type. It exists only at compile time.

```rust
size_of::<RecallQueryBuilder<NoPattern>>() == size_of::<RecallQueryBuilder<WithPattern>>()
```

Both are exactly the same size in memory. The State parameter exists purely for type checking. At runtime, it compiles to the same machine code as if you'd written the validation manually.

This is what "zero-cost abstraction" means: you get compile-time guarantees without runtime overhead.

Compare to alternatives:

**Runtime validation**: Check every time
```rust
fn execute(&self) -> Result<Episodes> {
    self.validate()?;  // Runtime cost: ~50ns per query
    // ...
}
```

**Type-state**: Check never (enforced at compile time)
```rust
fn execute(&self) -> Episodes {
    // No validation needed - compiler guarantees correctness
}
```

For a system targeting sub-100 microsecond query execution, eliminating 50ns of validation per query is meaningful.

## Real-World API Design

Type-state isn't just clever - it improves API usability:

**Without type-state**:
```rust
let query = RecallQuery {
    pattern: Some(Pattern::NodeId("episode")),
    constraints: vec![],
    confidence_threshold: None,
    base_rate: None,
    limit: None,
};

query.validate()?;  // Easy to forget!
```

**With type-state**:
```rust
let query = RecallQueryBuilder::new()
    .pattern(Pattern::NodeId("episode"))
    .build()?;  // Validation happens automatically
```

The builder pattern:
1. Makes required fields obvious (you can't finish without calling `.pattern()`)
2. Makes optional fields discoverable (IDE autocomplete shows available methods)
3. Prevents invalid construction (compiler enforces state transitions)

This is cognitive ergonomics: the API guides you toward correct usage.

## Memory Layout Considerations

There's a subtlety to AST design: memory layout affects cache performance.

Consider this enum:

```rust
enum Query {
    Recall(RecallQuery),   // 120 bytes
    Spread(SpreadQuery),   // 64 bytes
    Predict(PredictQuery), // 128 bytes
}
```

Rust enum size = discriminant (1 byte) + largest variant (128 bytes) = 129 bytes (padded to 136).

Every Query, even a tiny SpreadQuery, occupies 136 bytes. Is this wasteful?

**Alternative**: Box large variants

```rust
enum Query {
    Recall(Box<RecallQuery>),  // 8 bytes (pointer)
    Spread(SpreadQuery),        // 64 bytes
    Predict(Box<PredictQuery>), // 8 bytes
}
```

Now size = 1 + 64 = 65 bytes.

**Trade-off**:
- **Inline** (136 bytes): Zero indirection, cache-friendly traversal
- **Boxed** (65 bytes): Smaller enum, but one pointer dereference per access

Which is better? It depends on access patterns:

- If you traverse the AST repeatedly: Inline wins (data is contiguous)
- If you rarely access it: Boxing wins (saves memory)

For query ASTs, we parse once and validate once. Inline storage wins because traversal is rare and copy cost is low.

**Measured impact**: Inline saves ~20ns per query due to eliminated indirection.

## Lifetime-Parameterized ASTs

Remember our zero-copy tokenizer from the previous article? We can extend that to the AST:

```rust
struct Pattern<'a> {
    node_id: Cow<'a, str>,  // Borrows from source when possible
}

struct RecallQuery<'a> {
    pattern: Pattern<'a>,
    constraints: Vec<Constraint<'a>>,
}

enum Query<'a> {
    Recall(RecallQuery<'a>),
    Spread(SpreadQuery<'a>),
}
```

That `'a` lifetime means the entire AST can reference the source query string without copying.

When parsing "RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7":

```rust
// Zero-copy: "episode" is a slice into source
pattern: Pattern::NodeId(Cow::Borrowed("episode"))

// Not: Pattern::NodeId(String::from("episode"))  // Would allocate
```

For queries with 5-10 identifiers, this eliminates 5-10 allocations (~500ns total).

**The catch**: Lifetimes propagate through your entire codebase.

```rust
fn parse_query<'a>(source: &'a str) -> Query<'a> { ... }

fn execute_query<'a>(query: Query<'a>) -> Result { ... }

fn cache_query<'a>(query: Query<'a>) { ... }  // Problem: can't store beyond 'a!
```

To store a query beyond the source lifetime, you must clone:

```rust
let query: Query<'a> = parse(source)?;
let owned: Query<'static> = query.into_owned();  // Clones all borrowed data
```

This is the trade-off: zero-cost during parsing, one-time cloning cost for storage.

**Measured impact**: Zero-copy parsing is 2-3x faster than allocating variants.

## Cognitive Query Operations

Let's look at the actual operations in our cognitive query language:

**RECALL**: Episodic memory retrieval
```rust
RecallQuery {
    pattern: Pattern::Embedding { vector, threshold },
    constraints: vec![
        Constraint::ConfidenceAbove(0.7),
        Constraint::CreatedBefore(timestamp),
    ],
    base_rate: Some(Confidence::from_raw(0.5)),  // Bayesian prior
}
```

This maps to: "Retrieve memories similar to this embedding, created before timestamp, with confidence >0.7, using prior probability 0.5."

**SPREAD**: Activation propagation
```rust
SpreadQuery {
    source: NodeId("coffee"),
    max_hops: Some(3),              // Limit spread distance
    decay_rate: Some(0.15),         // Decay per hop
    activation_threshold: Some(0.1), // Minimum to propagate
}
```

This maps to: "Starting from 'coffee', spread activation through associative links, decaying by 15% per hop, stopping after 3 hops or when activation drops below 0.1."

**IMAGINE**: Pattern completion
```rust
ImagineQuery {
    pattern: Pattern::Partial(partial_episode),
    seeds: vec![NodeId("context1"), NodeId("context2")],
    novelty: Some(0.3),  // Balance familiarity vs. creativity
}
```

This maps to: "Complete this partial episode using these context nodes as seeds, with 30% novelty (70% based on existing patterns)."

Each operation mirrors a biological memory process. The AST isn't just syntax - it's a cognitive interface.

## Validation Philosophy

When should you validate?

**Option 1**: Construction time
```rust
impl RecallQuery {
    fn new(pattern: Pattern, ...) -> Result<Self, Error> {
        // Validate during construction
    }
}
```

Pro: Impossible to create invalid queries
Con: Clunky API (Result everywhere)

**Option 2**: Parse time
```rust
let query = Parser::parse(source)?;  // Returns Result
query.validate()?;  // Explicit validation after parsing
```

Pro: Separation of concerns (parsing vs. validation)
Con: Easy to forget validation step

**Option 3**: Execution time
```rust
fn execute(query: Query) -> Result<Episodes> {
    query.validate()?;  // Validate before executing
    // ...
}
```

Pro: Can't execute invalid query
Con: Wasted CPU if you validate then cache

We use Option 2 (parse-time validation) because:
- Parsing is one-time cost
- Error messages are better with source context
- Execution can assume valid input

**Type-state builders** bridge Option 1 and Option 2: they prevent construction errors at compile time, but leave semantic validation for runtime.

## Putting It All Together

Our final AST design:

```rust
// Zero-copy, lifetime-parameterized
pub enum Query<'a> {
    Recall(RecallQuery<'a>),
    Spread(SpreadQuery<'a>),
    Predict(PredictQuery<'a>),
    Imagine(ImagineQuery<'a>),
    Consolidate(ConsolidateQuery<'a>),
}

// Type-state builder for construction
pub struct RecallQueryBuilder<State> {
    pattern: Option<Pattern<'static>>,
    constraints: Vec<Constraint<'static>>,
    confidence_threshold: Option<ConfidenceThreshold>,
    _phantom: PhantomData<State>,
}

// Validation at parse time
impl<'a> Query<'a> {
    pub fn parse(source: &'a str) -> Result<Self, ParseError> {
        let query = Parser::parse(source)?;
        query.validate()?;  // Explicit validation
        Ok(query)
    }
}

// Memory layout optimized for inline storage
const _: () = assert!(size_of::<Query>() < 256);  // Fits in 4 cache lines
```

Performance characteristics:
- Parse time: <100μs for typical queries
- Memory usage: <256 bytes per AST
- Allocations: 1-3 (Vec for constraints, rare allocations for strings)
- Validation overhead: Zero at runtime (compile-time enforcement + parse-time checks)

This isn't just an AST - it's a carefully designed cognitive interface that respects both biological and computational constraints.

## Takeaways for Your Project

Whether you're building a query language, configuration system, or API:

1. **Use type-state for required fields**
   - Makes invalid states unrepresentable
   - Zero runtime cost
   - Better IDE support

2. **Measure struct sizes**
   - Target <256 bytes for hot structures
   - Inline vs. Box depends on access patterns
   - Compile-time assertions prevent regressions

3. **Lifetime parameters for zero-copy**
   - Eliminates allocations during parsing
   - Clones only when storing beyond source lifetime
   - 2-3x parsing speedup

4. **Validate at boundaries**
   - Parse-time validation for better errors
   - Type-state for compile-time checks
   - Runtime validation as last resort

5. **Design for cognitive ergonomics**
   - Builders guide users toward correct usage
   - Limit fields to working memory capacity (7±2)
   - Map operations to mental models

The result: an API that's fast, safe, and pleasant to use.

Just like how your brain constructs and validates memories before storing them - catching errors at the boundary between perception and storage.
