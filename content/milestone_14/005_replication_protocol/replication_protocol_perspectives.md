# Perspectives: Replication Protocol

## Perspective 1: Systems Architecture Optimizer

Asynchronous replication is fundamentally about minimizing critical path latency. Synchronous replication forces writes to wait for network round trips - 1ms to local datacenter replicas, 50-200ms cross-region. For Engram targeting <10ms write latency, synchronous isn't viable.

The optimization: pipeline WAL shipping. Don't wait for acknowledgment before sending the next batch. Use TCP window scaling to keep multiple batches in flight. This hides network latency behind application processing.

Lock-free WAL implementation is critical. Use a ring buffer where writers append via atomic CAS, readers (shipper threads) batch consecutive entries. No locks means writers never block each other.

## Perspective 2: Rust Graph Engine Architect

From a graph perspective, replication is state machine replication. The primary and replicas are state machines processing the same operation log. As long as operations are deterministic and applied in order, replicas converge to identical state.

For Engram, operations on memory nodes and edges are commutative within a space (different spaces never interact). This means we can relax ordering: batch operations can apply in any order per-space without affecting correctness.

Implementation uses per-space operation queues. Replication ships batches per-space, replicas apply in parallel across spaces. This parallelizes replica catchup significantly.

## Perspective 3: Verification Testing Lead

Testing replication requires failure injection. My test framework:

1. Run primary plus 2 replicas
2. Write stream of operations to primary
3. Inject primary crash after random number of writes
4. Promote replica to primary
5. Verify: all acknowledged writes survived, no extra writes appeared

Property: acknowledged writes must be durable with probability > 99.99%.

Measure replication lag under various load conditions: steady state (low), burst writes (medium), network congestion (high). Verify lag never causes unavailability.

## Perspective 4: Cognitive Architecture Designer

Biological memory formation isn't instantaneous. Experiences need consolidation to become long-term memories. Asynchronous replication mirrors this: immediate encoding (primary write) followed by gradual consolidation (replication to other nodes).

The brain accepts that trauma can disrupt very recent memory formation - retrograde amnesia. Engram's async replication accepts similar data loss probability for recent writes. This biological realism prioritizes system responsiveness over perfect durability.
