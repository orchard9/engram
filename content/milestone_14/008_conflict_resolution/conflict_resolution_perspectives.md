# Perspectives: Conflict Resolution

## Perspective 1: Systems Architecture Optimizer

Conflict resolution must be deterministic and commutative. If Node A merges (P1, P2) and Node B merges (P2, P1), they must get identical results. Otherwise nodes diverge indefinitely.

The key: use deterministic tiebreakers. Confidence-weighted averaging is commutative. Vector clock merging is commutative. Node ID tiebreaking (when all else equal) is deterministic.

Lock-free conflict resolution is possible because merges are pure functions of inputs. No coordination needed, just apply merge function to concurrent patterns.

## Perspective 2: Rust Graph Engine Architect

Pattern conflicts are graph isomorphism problems. Two patterns with overlapping episodes might represent the same semantic concept. Detecting this requires subgraph matching.

For efficiency, use embedding similarity as a fast filter. If pattern embeddings are >0.9 similar, likely the same concept - merge them. If <0.5 similar, likely different concepts - keep both.

This heuristic avoids expensive graph isomorphism checks in the common case.

## Perspective 3: Verification Testing Lead

Property-based testing for conflict resolution:

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn merge_is_commutative(p1: Pattern, p2: Pattern) {
        let m1 = merge(p1.clone(), p2.clone());
        let m2 = merge(p2, p1);
        assert_eq!(m1, m2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn merge_preserves_information(p1: Pattern, p2: Pattern) {
        let merged = merge(p1.clone(), p2.clone());
        assert!(merged.episodes.is_superset(&p1.episodes));
        assert!(merged.episodes.is_superset(&p2.episodes));
    }
}
```

## Perspective 4: Cognitive Architecture Designer

The brain handles conflicting memories through reconsolidation. When retrieving a memory, it becomes labile and can be updated with new information. Conflicts between old and new get resolved through confidence-weighted integration - exactly what Engram does.

This biological realism means conflicts aren't errors - they're opportunities to integrate diverse experiences into richer semantic representations.
