# Perspectives: Node Discovery and Configuration

## Perspective 1: Systems Architecture Optimizer

From a systems architecture standpoint, discovery is fundamentally about minimizing the time-to-first-connection while maintaining robustness. The naive approach - try every possible peer - has O(N) connection attempts and can take minutes for large clusters.

The optimization insight: use a hierarchy of discovery methods ordered by latency. Static seeds are instant (cached in memory), DNS lookups take 10-50ms, cloud provider APIs take 100-500ms. Try fast methods first.

For Engram, I'd implement this as a priority queue of discovery strategies:

```rust
struct DiscoveryStrategy {
    priority: u8,  // Lower is higher priority
    method: Box<dyn DiscoveryMethod>,
    cache_ttl: Duration,
}
```

Static seeds get priority 0, DNS gets priority 1, cloud APIs get priority 2. Each method caches results with appropriate TTL to avoid redundant lookups.

The critical performance optimization is parallel probing. Once you have candidate peers, don't try them sequentially - fire off connection attempts to all of them concurrently and take the first K successes. This reduces join time from O(N Ã— connection_timeout) to O(connection_timeout).

Lock-free caching is key. Multiple threads might trigger discovery simultaneously during startup. Use `ArcSwap` to atomically update the cached peer list, and `AtomicU64` for the cache timestamp. No locks, no blocking.

For Kubernetes specifically, use client-side caching of the pod list. The Kubernetes watch API lets you maintain a local cache that's updated incrementally, avoiding expensive API calls on every discovery attempt.

## Perspective 2: Rust Graph Engine Architect

Discovery is a graph problem: find a path from this node to any existing cluster member. The cluster topology is a graph where nodes are instances and edges are network connectivity.

From a graph perspective, each discovery method explores a different subgraph:
- Static seeds: explicitly defined edges
- DNS: edges derived from naming convention
- Cloud API: edges derived from infrastructure metadata

The join protocol is then a graph traversal: starting from candidate edges (discovered peers), perform breadth-first search to find all reachable nodes.

For implementation, represent the discovery state as a temporal graph:

```rust
struct DiscoveryGraph {
    // Nodes are potential peers
    nodes: DashMap<SocketAddr, NodeCandidate>,
    // Edges are successful connections
    edges: DashMap<(SocketAddr, SocketAddr), ConnectivityInfo>,
}

struct NodeCandidate {
    addr: SocketAddr,
    discovered_at: Instant,
    discovery_method: DiscoveryMethod,
    connectivity: AtomicU8,  // 0=unknown, 1=reachable, 2=unreachable
}
```

When joining, we're solving the single-source reachability problem: "Can I reach any node in the existing cluster?" This reduces to finding the shortest path in the discovery graph.

The nice thing about this representation is that failed connection attempts become valuable data. If we can't reach Node A directly but can reach Node B, and B can reach A, we learn about network topology. This informs future routing decisions.

Engram's spreading activation mechanism maps perfectly here. Discovery becomes an activation query: "Activate all nodes reachable from my current position." The spreading threshold determines how many hops we're willing to try.

## Perspective 3: Verification Testing Lead

Testing discovery is challenging because it involves external systems. My strategy: test each layer independently, then integrate.

**Layer 1: Unit Tests for Discovery Logic**

Mock each discovery method and verify the fallback behavior:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_discovery_fallback_order() {
    let mut discovery = Discovery::new();

    // Mock static seeds to fail
    discovery.set_seeds(vec![]);

    // Mock DNS to return candidates
    discovery.set_dns_resolver(MockDns::with_records(vec![
        "10.0.1.1:7946",
        "10.0.1.2:7946",
    ]));

    let peers = discovery.discover().await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(peers.len(), 2);
    assert_eq!(discovery.method_used(), DiscoveryMethod::Dns);
}
```

Key invariants:
- Discovery never returns an empty list if any method succeeds
- Methods are tried in priority order
- Failed methods don't prevent later methods from running
- Caching respects TTL boundaries

**Layer 2: Integration Tests with Real Infrastructure**

Spin up actual DNS servers and cloud provider mocks:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_dns_srv_discovery_integration() {
    // Start a real DNS server with test records
    let dns_server = TestDnsServer::start().await;
    dns_server.add_srv_record(
        "_engram._tcp.test.local",
        vec![
            (0, 0, 7946, "node1.test.local"),
            (0, 0, 7946, "node2.test.local"),
        ],
    );

    let discovery = Discovery::with_dns("_engram._tcp.test.local");
    let peers = discovery.discover().await.unwrap();

    assert_eq!(peers.len(), 2);
}
```

For cloud provider testing, use actual Kubernetes test clusters or localstack for AWS mocking.

**Layer 3: Chaos Testing**

Test discovery under adverse conditions:
- DNS returns NXDOMAIN
- Cloud API is rate-limited
- Seed nodes are unreachable
- Network is partitioned

Use a network simulator to inject failures and verify discovery still works through alternative methods.

**Layer 4: Property-Based Testing**

Generate arbitrary discovery configurations and verify properties:

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn discovery_always_returns_valid_addrs(
        seeds in vec(socket_addr(), 0..10),
        dns_records in vec(socket_addr(), 0..10)
    ) {
        let discovery = Discovery {
            seeds: Some(seeds),
            dns: Some(MockDns::with_addrs(dns_records)),
        };

        let result = block_on(discovery.discover());

        // Property: if any method has addresses, discovery succeeds
        if !seeds.is_empty() || !dns_records.is_empty() {
            assert!(result.is_ok());
            let peers = result.unwrap();
            // All returned addresses are valid
            for peer in peers {
                assert!(peer.port() > 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Perspective 4: Cognitive Architecture Designer

From a cognitive perspective, node discovery is analogous to memory formation. A newborn brain doesn't come pre-wired with all its connections. Instead, neurons discover each other through activity-dependent processes.

The biological analog to node discovery is synaptogenesis - the formation of new synaptic connections. This happens through:
1. **Chemical gradients** (like DNS - follow the trail to find neurons)
2. **Activity correlation** (like cloud API - neurons that fire together wire together)
3. **Random exploration** (like trying random seeds - stochastic connection formation)

Engram's layered discovery approach mirrors how the developing brain uses multiple cues to wire itself:
- **Genetic blueprints** (static seeds): Some connections are hardcoded
- **Chemical signals** (DNS): Neurons follow molecular gradients to find partners
- **Electrical activity** (cloud metadata): Active neurons attract connections

The fallback mechanism is particularly brain-like. If one guidance mechanism fails, development doesn't halt - alternative mechanisms take over. This robustness is critical for cognitive systems operating in unpredictable environments.

From a memory consolidation perspective, discovery is the first step in building the distributed knowledge graph. A single-node Engram is like a brain with isolated regions. Discovery enables inter-regional communication, allowing memories to consolidate across nodes.

The caching behavior (TTL-based re-discovery) mirrors how the brain periodically reinforces connections through neural replay. Connections that aren't actively used don't just disappear - they're checked periodically and either strengthened (if still valid) or pruned (if the target is gone).

This biological framing helps explain why Engram's discovery system is more complex than a simple "list of IP addresses." Like neural development, distributed system formation requires multiple complementary mechanisms operating at different timescales, with graceful degradation when components fail.
