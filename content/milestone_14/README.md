## Key Performance Numbers

Across all tasks, these performance targets are cited:

- **SWIM failure detection**: <2s mean, <5s p99 for 100-node cluster
- **Gossip convergence**: 60s for 100 nodes (O(log N) rounds)
- **Replication lag**: <1s under normal load, <10ms write latency
- **Query latency**: <2x single-node for intra-partition queries
- **Partition tolerance**: 99.9% availability during 50% node loss
- **Routing overhead**: <1ms per hop
- **Space assignment balance**: <5% standard deviation with virtual nodes
- **Conflict rate**: 0.3% of patterns during gossip sync

## Consistency Guarantees

Engram's distributed architecture provides:

- **Read-your-writes**: On primary node
- **Eventual consistency**: All nodes converge within 60s
- **Bounded staleness**: Confidence penalties reflect divergence probability
- **No data loss**: <0.01% probability under failures
- **Causal consistency**: Via vector clocks
