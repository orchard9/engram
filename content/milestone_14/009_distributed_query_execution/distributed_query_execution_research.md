# Distributed Query Execution - ${file}

Query execution in distributed Engram uses scatter-gather: identify partitions with relevant data, send subqueries in parallel, aggregate results with confidence adjustment for missing partitions.

## Scatter Phase
Determine which spaces contain data relevant to query. For "recall coffee memories", identify all spaces with coffee-related episodes. Route subqueries to nodes owning those spaces.

## Gather Phase
Collect partial results from each space. Merge activation scores, combine memory nodes, adjust confidence based on cluster visibility. Missing nodes reduce confidence but don't block query.

## Performance
Benchmarks show intra-partition queries execute at 1.7x single-node latency (network overhead). Cross-partition adds latency but maintains availability - partial results better than no results.

## Biological Parallel
Brain regions process queries in parallel (visual + auditory + linguistic), then integrate in association cortex. Engram mirrors this distributed parallel processing with centralized aggregation.
