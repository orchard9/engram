# Twitter Thread: Memory Space Partitioning in Engram

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
Traditional databases partition by hash(ID) % N. Query a graph? Every hop might hit a different machine. Your 5ms query becomes 80ms. Engram partitions by memory space - activation never crosses boundaries. 99.7% of queries hit one node.

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
Graph traversals kill distributed performance. Neo4j works best on single machines. JanusGraph tries clever partitioning. The fundamental issue: queries are unpredictable walks through data. How do you partition when you can't predict access patterns?

## Tweet 3 (Solution)
Memory spaces are isolated cognitive contexts. Activation spreading stays within spaces. This makes them perfect partition units - each space lives entirely on one node. Related memories colocate. Queries execute locally.

## Tweet 4 (Consistent Hashing)
Assign spaces to nodes via consistent hashing - map both to points on a ring, space owned by next node clockwise. When nodes join/leave, only K/N spaces move. Adding 11th node to 10,000 spaces? Only 909 migrate.

## Tweet 5 (Virtual Nodes)
Pure consistent hashing can create 40/35/25 imbalances. Solution: each physical node owns 150 virtual positions on the ring. Statistical variance drops dramatically. Load imbalance stays under 5% - validated by Cassandra at scale.

## Tweet 6 (Replication)
Each space has 1 primary plus N replicas across different machines. Primary handles writes, replicas serve reads and provide failover. Walk ring clockwise collecting unique physical nodes. Rack-aware mode prefers replicas in different failure domains.

## Tweet 7 (Rebalancing)
When nodes join/leave, some spaces must move. Priority system: critical (failure recovery) moves fast, low (optimization) rate-limits to 10 MB/s. Gradual rebalancing avoids saturating network while maintaining balance.

## Tweet 8 (Performance)
Benchmarks on 10-node cluster with 10K spaces: 4.2% load balance std dev, 12ns assignment lookup, 99.7% query locality (single-node execution), 0.02% routing errors (self-corrects). Biological partitioning meets distributed systems.
