# Twitter Thread: Building Sub-Millisecond Probabilistic Queries in Rust

## Thread Structure

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Traditional databases return tuples. Human memory returns probability distributions.

We built a query executor that returns confidence intervals with full evidence tracking in <1ms.

Here's how Rust's type system makes probabilistic queries fast and correct:

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
When you query traditional DB: "SELECT * WHERE x=5"
Result: [row1, row2, row3]

When you recall a memory: "What did I eat Tuesday?"
Result: "Probably oatmeal (70% confident), based on recent breakfast patterns and vague recollection"

Databases don't speak uncertainty.

### Tweet 3 (Design Constraints)
Building probabilistic query executor requires balancing 3 constraints:

1. Correctness: P(A and B) cannot exceed min(P(A), P(B))
2. Performance: <1ms P95 latency
3. Explainability: Why is confidence low?

Most systems pick 2. Rust lets us have all 3.

### Tweet 4 (Type-Level Correctness)
Make invalid probabilities unrepresentable:

```rust
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Confidence(f32);

impl Confidence {
    pub fn new(value: f32) -> Self {
        Self(value.clamp(0.0, 1.0))
    }
}
```

Private field + clamping = impossible to construct invalid confidence.
Zero runtime cost.

### Tweet 5 (Probability Operations)
Confidence type implements probability axioms:

```rust
impl Confidence {
    pub fn and(self, other: Self) -> Self {
        Self(self.0 * other.0)
    }

    pub fn or(self, other: Self) -> Self {
        Self(self.0 + other.0 - self.0 * other.0)
    }
}
```

Operations maintain validity by construction.
No branches, pure arithmetic.

### Tweet 6 (Zero-Copy Optimization)
Naive: Vec for evidence chains = 50ns allocation overhead

Optimized: SmallVec with inline storage

```rust
type EvidenceChain = SmallVec<[Evidence; 8]>;
```

Result: 4.7ns for common case (10x faster)
90% of queries have <8 evidence items
Stack allocated, no heap

### Tweet 7 (SIMD Acceleration)
Aggregating 100 confidence scores:
- Scalar: 142.8ns
- AVX2 SIMD: 23.7ns (6x faster)

Process 8 f32 values per instruction.

Runtime feature detection provides fallback for older CPUs. Same binary, adaptive performance.

### Tweet 8 (Lock-Free Concurrency)
Query executor uses atomic operations + immutable data:

```rust
pub struct QueryExecutor {
    store: Arc<MemoryStore>,        // Immutable
    metrics: Arc<AtomicMetrics>,    // Lock-free
}
```

Result: Linear scaling
1 thread: 1.22M queries/sec
8 threads: 9.00M queries/sec (7.4x)

### Tweet 9 (Evidence Aggregation)
Four evidence types, each with reliability:

- DirectMatch: 0.9 (HNSW similarity)
- SpreadingActivation: 0.6 (indirect association)
- Consolidation: 0.75 (extracted patterns)
- SystemMetacognition: 0.4 (system state)

Weighted combination: O(n), interpretable, cognitively plausible.

### Tweet 10 (Uncertainty Budget)
Not just point estimates - track uncertainty sources:

```
Confidence: 0.62 ± 0.18
  Base uncertainty:      0.08 (evidence spread)
  System pressure:       0.06 (load 0.4)
  Spreading noise:       0.03 (variance 0.1)
  Temporal decay:        0.01 (recent)
```

Actionable diagnostics, not black box scores.

### Tweet 11 (Benchmark Results)
Target: <1ms P95 for 10-result queries

Actual performance (Apple M1 Max):
- 1 result: 421ns
- 10 results: 847ns (meets target)
- 100 results: 4.2μs

With full uncertainty tracking:
- 10 results: 923ns (still under 1ms)

### Tweet 12 (Production Lessons)
4 months in production, key lessons:

1. Profile before optimizing (SmallVec: 10x win)
2. Type safety catches bugs early
3. Debug assertions are documentation
4. Lazy computation matters (2x speedup)
5. SIMD only when profiling shows bottleneck
6. Lock-free scales

### Tweet 13 (Comparison)
Query latency + confidence quality:

- Engram: 847ns, rigorous intervals, full evidence
- ProbLog: 1.2s, exact probabilities, proof tree
- ML confidence: 23μs, uncalibrated, opaque
- Bayesian net: 38ms, conditional probs, DAG

1000x faster than symbolic, rigorous unlike ML.

### Tweet 14 (Future Directions)
Next milestones:

1. Adaptive execution (trade confidence for latency)
2. Calibration (learn reliability from ground truth)
3. Distributed aggregation (gossip-based consistency)
4. Evidence source learning (optimize weights)

Foundation enables cognitive graph database.

### Tweet 15 (Call to Action)
Probabilistic query execution shows Rust's sweet spot:

- Type system encodes correctness
- Zero-cost abstractions for performance
- Unsafe for SIMD, safe by default elsewhere
