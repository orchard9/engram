- Disaster recovery runbooks with actual commands
- Migration validation checklists
- Performance profiling methodology

**Time Estimates:**
- Deployment: <2 hours (actual: 45 minutes)

**Troubleshooting Guidance:**
- Common failure modes identified
- Diagnostic commands provided
- Rollback procedures documented
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds

## Content Style Adherence

Following Julia Evans' philosophy throughout:

1. **Start with WHY**
   - Container article starts with "The Container Tax Problem"
   - Backup article starts with "Untested backups are Schrödinger's backups"
   - Performance article starts with actual 20ms → 3ms journey

2. **Concrete Examples**
   - Every optimization shows before/after code
   - Every procedure includes actual commands
   - Every metric includes measured numbers

3. **Honest Tradeoffs**
   - Host networking: Fast but port conflicts possible
   - Full backups: Slow but simple restore
   - SIMD: Fast but complex, last optimization only

4. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Overview → detailed implementation → edge cases
   - Simple explanation → technical details → code
   - Common case → advanced scenarios

5. **Runnable Code**
   - All bash scripts are executable
   - All Rust examples compile
   - All YAML manifests are valid

6. **Visual Metaphors**
   - Containers as "execution environment, like Linux to a process"
   - Backups as "time machine" (PITR)
   - Migration as "dual-write bridge" not "cut-and-paste"
