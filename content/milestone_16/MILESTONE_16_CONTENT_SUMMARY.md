## Content Style and Approach

All content follows Julia Evans' technical communication philosophy:

1. **Start with WHY** - Why operators need this, not just how it works
2. **Concrete examples** - Real commands, actual configurations
3. **Measured results** - No hand-waving, actual performance numbers
4. **Honest tradeoffs** - When to use each approach, costs and benefits
5. **Runnable code** - Every example can be copy-pasted and executed
6. **Visual aids** - ASCII diagrams for complex concepts
7. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple overview, then details
8. **Failure scenarios** - What can go wrong and how to fix it

## Operational Focus Areas
