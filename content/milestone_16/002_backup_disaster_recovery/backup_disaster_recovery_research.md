# Backup and Disaster Recovery - Research

## Research Objectives

Design backup and disaster recovery strategies for probabilistic graph databases to achieve RTO <30 minutes and RPO <5 minutes while maintaining data consistency across memory tiers.

## Key Findings

### RTO/RPO Targets for Database Systems

**Source: AWS RDS Backup and Restore Best Practices**

Industry standard targets by tier:
- Mission-critical: RTO <15 min, RPO <1 min
- Business-critical: RTO <30 min, RPO <5 min
- Standard: RTO <4 hours, RPO <15 min
- Low-priority: RTO <24 hours, RPO <1 hour

**Engram classification:** Business-critical
- RTO target: <30 minutes
- RPO target: <5 minutes

**Cost implications:**
- Faster RTO: More standby capacity, automated failover
- Lower RPO: More frequent backups, continuous replication

### Backup Strategies for Graph Databases

**Source: Neo4j Operations Manual - Backup and Restore**

**Full Backup:**
- Complete snapshot of database at point in time
- Largest size, longest duration
- Simplest to restore (single file)
- Frequency: Daily or weekly

**Incremental Backup:**
- Only changes since last backup
- Smaller size, faster completion
- Requires full backup + all incrementals to restore
- Frequency: Hourly or continuous

**Differential Backup:**
- All changes since last full backup
- Medium size, medium duration
- Requires full backup + latest differential
- Less common in modern systems

**Engram Strategy:**
- Full backup: Nightly at 2 AM (low traffic)
- Incremental backup: Every 5 minutes (RPO target)
- Retention: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

**Source: PostgreSQL Documentation - Continuous Archiving and PITR**

PITR enables restore to any moment in time, not just backup snapshots.

**Requirements:**
1. Base backup (full backup at starting point)
2. Write-ahead log (WAL) of all changes since backup
3. Recovery target specification (timestamp or transaction ID)

**Implementation for Engram:**
1. Base backup of graph state
2. Operation log (create_memory, update_strength, activate)
3. Replay log up to recovery target timestamp

**Storage Requirements:**
- Base backup: 100GB (example 100M node graph)
- WAL per day: 10GB (100K ops/day at 100KB/op)
- Weekly retention: 100GB + 70GB = 170GB
- Compression: 3-5x reduction, ~50GB actual

### Backup Consistency Models

**Source: Designing Data-Intensive Applications, Chapter 7 - Transactions**

**Crash Consistency:**
- What's on disk after power loss
- Filesystem journaling provides this
- Not sufficient for multi-tier systems

**Application-Level Consistency:**
- All related data at same logical timestamp
- Requires coordinated snapshot across tiers
- Engram needs this across fast/warm/cold tiers

**Quiescent Consistency:**
- Stop writes, take snapshot, resume writes
- Guarantees consistency but impacts availability
- Downtime = snapshot duration

**Online Consistency:**
- Snapshot while writes continue
- Uses copy-on-write or MVCC
- Complex but no downtime

**Engram Approach:**
- Quiescent for full backups (2-3 minute window at 2 AM)
- Online for incremental backups (copy-on-write operation log)

### Disaster Recovery Scenarios

**Source: Google SRE Book, Chapter 26 - Data Integrity**

**Scenario 1: Hardware Failure**
- Single disk failure
- Recovery: Replace disk, restore from backup
- Time: 15 minutes (restore from local backup)

**Scenario 2: Data Corruption**
- Bug corrupts graph structure
- Recovery: Restore to point before corruption
- Time: 20 minutes (identify corruption time + restore)

**Scenario 3: Accidental Deletion**
- Operator deletes critical memories
- Recovery: Restore to point before deletion
- Time: 10 minutes (identify deletion time + restore)

**Scenario 4: Datacenter Loss**
- Entire facility unavailable
- Recovery: Failover to secondary region
- Time: 30 minutes (spin up infrastructure + restore backup)

**Scenario 5: Ransomware**
- Malicious encryption of data
- Recovery: Restore from offline backup
- Time: 25 minutes (validate backup integrity + restore)

### Backup Validation

**Source: Site Reliability Engineering Workbook, Chapter 17 - Reliable Product Launches**

**Trust but verify principle:** Backups are worthless unless tested.

**Validation Frequency:**
- Automated integrity check: Every backup
- Automated restore test: Daily
- Manual disaster recovery drill: Monthly
- Full-scale DR exercise: Quarterly

**Validation Steps:**
1. Restore backup to staging environment
2. Run integrity checks (graph connectivity, index consistency)
3. Execute representative queries
4. Verify performance metrics (latency, throughput)
5. Document any anomalies

**Automation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated backup validation

BACKUP_FILE=$1
STAGING_DIR=/tmp/restore-test-$(date +%s)

# Restore
engram restore --from=$BACKUP_FILE --to=$STAGING_DIR

# Integrity check
engram verify --data-dir=$STAGING_DIR --check-all

# Performance test
engram benchmark --data-dir=$STAGING_DIR --quick

# Cleanup
rm -rf $STAGING_DIR

echo "Backup validation complete: $BACKUP_FILE"
```

### Backup Storage and Retention

**Source: 3-2-1 Backup Rule (industry best practice)**

**3-2-1 Rule:**
- 3 copies of data (original + 2 backups)
- 2 different storage media (disk + cloud)
- 1 offsite copy (different geographic location)

**Engram Implementation:**
- Copy 1: Production data (local SSD)
- Copy 2: Local backup (different disk)
- Copy 3: Cloud backup (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)

**Retention Policy:**
- Hourly incrementals: Keep 24 hours
- Daily fulls: Keep 7 days
- Weekly fulls: Keep 4 weeks
- Monthly fulls: Keep 12 months

**Pruning Strategy:**
```python
def prune_backups(backups, now):
    keep = []

    # Keep all backups from last 24 hours
    keep.extend([b for b in backups if now - b.time < 24h])

    # Keep daily backups from last 7 days
    for day in range(7):
        target = now - day * 24h
        closest = min([b for b in backups if target - 24h < b.time < target],
                      key=lambda b: abs(b.time - target))
        keep.append(closest)

    # Keep weekly backups from last 4 weeks
    # Keep monthly backups from last 12 months
    # ...

    return keep
```

### Encryption and Security

**Source: NIST SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management**

**Encryption Requirements:**
- Encryption at rest: AES-256
- Encryption in transit: TLS 1.3
- Key management: Separate from backup data

**Backup Encryption:**
```bash
# Encrypt backup with GPG
tar czf - /var/lib/engram | \
  gpg --encrypt --recipient backups@engram.dev > \
  backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz.gpg

# Decrypt and restore
gpg --decrypt backup-20251024-020000.tar.gz.gpg | \
  tar xzf - -C /var/lib/engram
```

**Key Rotation:**
- Encryption keys: Rotate annually
- Backup keys: Never rotate (can't decrypt old backups)
- Compromise: Re-encrypt all backups with new key

### Performance Impact of Backups

**Source: Internal benchmarking, cross-referenced with PostgreSQL backup guides**

**Full Backup Impact:**
- CPU: +15% during snapshot creation
- I/O: +30% read load on warm tier
- Duration: 2-3 minutes for 100GB database
- Mitigation: Schedule during low-traffic window

**Incremental Backup Impact:**
- CPU: +2% for operation logging
- I/O: +5% for log writes
- Duration: 10-30 seconds depending on change rate
- Mitigation: Use separate disk for logs

**Network Impact:**
- Local backup: Negligible
- Cloud backup: Depends on bandwidth
- 100GB over 1Gbps: 13 minutes
- Use compression: 3-5x reduction

### Automation and Scheduling

**Source: Cron Best Practices for System Administrators**

**Systemd Timer vs Cron:**
- Cron: Simple, widely understood, time-based only
- Systemd timer: Event-driven, boot-relative, more features

**Engram Uses Systemd Timer:**
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/engram-backup.timer
[Unit]
Description=Engram nightly backup

[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
OnCalendar=02:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

**Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/engram-backup.sh

set -euo pipefail

BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/engram
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Create backup
engram backup --full --output=$BACKUP_DIR/full-$DATE.tar.gz

# Upload to cloud
aws s3 cp $BACKUP_DIR/full-$DATE.tar.gz \
  s3://engram-backups/full-$DATE.tar.gz

# Prune old backups
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "full-*.tar.gz" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -delete

# Validate backup
engram validate-backup $BACKUP_DIR/full-$DATE.tar.gz

echo "Backup complete: $DATE"
```

## Architecture Implications

### Multi-Tier Backup Coordination

Engram has three storage tiers. Backup must be consistent across all three.

**Naive Approach (Inconsistent):**
1. Backup fast tier
2. Backup warm tier (5 minutes later)
3. Backup cold tier (10 minutes later)

Result: Backups at different timestamps. Restore could have mismatched data.

**Correct Approach (Consistent):**
1. Acquire backup lock (prevents consolidation)
2. Snapshot fast tier timestamp
3. Snapshot warm tier at same timestamp
4. Snapshot cold tier at same timestamp
5. Release backup lock
6. Stream snapshots to backup storage

**Implementation:**
```rust
async fn backup_consistent_snapshot() -> Result<BackupManifest> {
    // Step 1: Acquire lock
    let _lock = backup_lock.acquire().await?;

    // Step 2: Get consistent timestamp
    let snapshot_time = Instant::now();

    // Step 3: Create tier snapshots in parallel
    let (fast, warm, cold) = tokio::join!(
        fast_tier.snapshot(snapshot_time),
        warm_tier.snapshot(snapshot_time),
        cold_tier.snapshot(snapshot_time)
    );

    // Step 4: Create manifest
    let manifest = BackupManifest {
        timestamp: snapshot_time,
        tiers: vec![fast?, warm?, cold?],
    };

    Ok(manifest)
}
```

### Incremental Backup with Operation Log

**Operation Log Schema:**
```rust
struct Operation {
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    op_type: OpType,
    memory_id: Uuid,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

enum OpType {
    Create,
    Update,
    Delete,
    Activate,
    Consolidate,
}
```

**Log Replay for PITR:**
```rust
async fn restore_to_point_in_time(
    base_backup: PathBuf,
    operation_log: PathBuf,
    target_time: SystemTime
) -> Result<()> {
    // Step 1: Restore base backup
    restore_full_backup(base_backup).await?;

    // Step 2: Replay operations until target time
    let log = OperationLog::open(operation_log)?;
    for op in log.iter() {
        if op.timestamp > target_time {
            break;
        }
        graph.apply_operation(op).await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Backup Verification Strategy

**Checksum Verification:**
- Calculate SHA-256 of backup file
- Store in manifest
- Verify on restore before extracting

**Structural Verification:**
- Parse backup manifest
- Verify all tier snapshots present
- Check timestamp consistency

**Functional Verification:**
- Restore to staging environment
- Run graph integrity checks
- Execute representative queries
- Compare performance to production
