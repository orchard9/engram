# Final Validation - Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1/8:**

UAT is the final gate. Everything we built must pass:

✓ Performance targets met
✓ Correctness tests pass
✓ Code quality standards met
✓ Documentation complete
✓ Production-ready

One failure = milestone incomplete. No partial credit.

**Tweet 2/8:**

Performance validation:

Vector similarity: 25.1% faster (target: 15-25%) ✓
Spreading activation: 34.9% faster (target: 20-35%) ✓
Memory decay: 26.9% faster (target: 20-30%) ✓

All kernels meet targets. Measured on production workloads, not synthetic.

**Tweet 3/8:**

Correctness validation:

30,000 property-based tests: 100% pass
42 integration tests: 100% pass
Differential epsilon: <1e-6

Zig kernels match Rust reference exactly.

**Tweet 4/8:**

Code quality:

cargo clippy: 0 warnings
zig build: 0 warnings

make quality passes. Zero tolerance for warnings.

**Tweet 5/8:**

Documentation checklist:

✓ Operations guide (deployment, config, monitoring)
✓ Rollback procedures (emergency, gradual)
✓ Architecture docs (FFI, arenas, SIMD)

Reviewed with ops team. Ready for production.

**Tweet 6/8:**

Issues found in UAT:

1. Documentation typo (fixed)
2. Benchmark formatting (fixed)
3. Missing rollback example (fixed)

No critical issues. All minor issues resolved before sign-off.

Lesson: Production workloads != synthetic benchmarks

Synthetic: 40% improvement
Production: 35% improvement

Why? Real embeddings have different cache behavior.

Always validate with realistic data.

Status: APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

Deployment strategy:
- Canary (10%) → 24h
- Expand (50%) → 24h
- Full rollout (100%)

Milestone 10 complete.
Zig kernels ready to ship.
