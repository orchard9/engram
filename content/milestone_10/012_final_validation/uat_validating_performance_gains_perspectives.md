# Final Validation - Perspectives

## Testing and Validation Perspective

UAT is the final gate. Everything must pass:

- Functional correctness: 100% of tests
- Performance targets: All kernels meet improvement goals
- Quality standards: Zero clippy warnings
- Documentation: Complete and accurate

One failure = milestone incomplete. No shortcuts.

## Systems Architecture Perspective

UAT validates not just that code works, but that it's production-ready:

- Can operators deploy it?
- Can they monitor it?
- Can they rollback if needed?

Code that works but can't be operated safely isn't ready.

## Cognitive Architecture Perspective

Performance improvements must be measured in realistic workloads, not synthetic benchmarks.

UAT uses real embedding distributions, real graph topologies, real query patterns. Only then can we claim "35% faster in production."
