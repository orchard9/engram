# UAT: Validating 15-35% Performance Gains in Production

User Acceptance Testing is the final gate. Everything we built, all the optimizations, all the careful engineering - it either meets acceptance criteria or it doesn't. No partial credit.

For Milestone 10 (Zig Performance Kernels), the acceptance criteria were clear:

1. Performance improvements: 15-35% on target operations
2. Correctness: 100% of tests pass
3. Code quality: Zero clippy warnings
4. Documentation: Complete deployment and rollback procedures
5. Production readiness: Validated deployment checklist

This is the story of how we validated each criterion.

## Performance Validation: Do The Numbers Hold Up?

We claimed specific performance improvements:
- Vector similarity: 15-25% faster
- Spreading activation: 20-35% faster
- Memory decay: 20-30% faster

UAT validates these claims with production workloads.

### Vector Similarity: 25% Improvement

Baseline (Rust):
```
Mean: 2.31 μs
p50:  2.28 μs
p95:  2.45 μs
p99:  2.58 μs
```

Zig SIMD kernel:
```
Mean: 1.73 μs
p50:  1.70 μs
p95:  1.82 μs
p99:  1.95 μs
```

Improvement: 25.1%

Target: 15-25%
Status: ✓ PASS (exceeds target)

### Spreading Activation: 35% Improvement

Baseline (Rust):
```
Mean: 147.2 μs (1000 nodes, 100 iterations)
p99:  163.7 μs
```

Zig kernel:
```
Mean: 95.8 μs
p99:  107.4 μs
```

Improvement: 34.9%

Target: 20-35%
Status: ✓ PASS (at upper bound)

### Memory Decay: 27% Improvement

Baseline (Rust):
```
Mean: 91.3 μs (10,000 memories)
p99:  104.5 μs
```

Zig kernel:
```
Mean: 66.7 μs
p99:  76.8 μs
```

Improvement: 26.9%

Target: 20-30%
Status: ✓ PASS

**Verdict:** All three kernels meet performance targets.

## Correctness Validation: Do They Work?

Performance means nothing if results are wrong.

### Differential Tests: 30,000 Property-Based Tests

Every Zig kernel tested against Rust reference:

```rust
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn zig_matches_rust(
        strengths in vec(0.0_f32..1.0, 100..1000),
        ages in vec(0_u64..1_000_000, 100..1000)
    ) {
        let mut zig_result = strengths.clone();
        let mut rust_result = strengths.clone();

        zig_decay(&mut zig_result, &ages);
        rust_decay(&mut rust_result, &ages);

        for (z, r) in zig_result.iter().zip(rust_result.iter()) {
            assert_relative_eq!(z, r, epsilon = 1e-6);
        }
    }
}
```

Results: 30,000 / 30,000 tests passed (100%)

Status: ✓ PASS

### Integration Tests: End-to-End Workflows

Complete memory consolidation pipeline:

1. Add 1000 memories
2. Compute similarity (Zig kernel)
3. Build graph edges
4. Spread activation (Zig kernel)
5. Apply decay (Zig kernel)
6. Query and retrieve

Compare Zig-enabled vs Rust-only paths:

```rust
let zig_results = graph_with_zig.query(&query, top_k=10);
let rust_results = graph_rust_only.query(&query, top_k=10);

assert_eq!(zig_results.memory_ids(), rust_results.memory_ids());
for (z, r) in zig_results.iter().zip(rust_results.iter()) {
    assert_relative_eq!(z.score, r.score, epsilon = 1e-3);
}
```

Results: 42 / 42 integration tests passed (100%)

Status: ✓ PASS

## Code Quality: Zero Warnings

Ran `make quality`:

```
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Results: 0 warnings

Checked all Zig code:

```
zig build --summary all
```

Results: 0 warnings

Status: ✓ PASS

## Sign-Off: Stakeholder Approval

| Role | Name | Date | Status |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Tech Lead | [Signature] | 2025-10-24 | Approved |
| QA Engineer | [Signature] | 2025-10-24 | Approved |
| Operations | [Signature] | 2025-10-24 | Approved |

All stakeholders approved for production deployment.

## Issues Found and Resolved

UAT caught three minor issues:

1. **Documentation typo:** Arena sizing table had wrong units (MB vs KB)
   - Fixed: Updated table with correct units
   - Impact: Low (cosmetic)

2. **Benchmark output formatting:** Regression results truncated decimals
   - Fixed: Adjusted format string for precision
   - Impact: Low (display only)

3. **Missing example:** Rollback guide lacked arena overflow scenario
   - Fixed: Added detailed example with commands
   - Impact: Medium (ops could be confused)

No critical issues. All resolved before sign-off.

## Lessons From UAT

### 1. Test With Production Data

Synthetic benchmarks showed 40% improvement. Production workloads showed 35%. The difference: real embeddings have different cache behavior than uniform random vectors.

Always validate with realistic data.

### 2. End-to-End Performance Matters More Than Kernel Performance

Zig kernels are 35% faster. But FFI overhead, memory copying, and graph traversal still dominate total query time.

Overall query improvement: 18% (not 35%).

Set expectations correctly.

### 3. Documentation Review Catches Mistakes

Operations walkthrough caught arena sizing typo and missing rollback example.

Review documentation with actual users before declaring "complete."

### 4. UAT Is Not Optional

We found 3 issues in UAT that earlier testing missed. None were critical, but all would have caused confusion in production.

Final validation matters.

## Deployment Recommendation

**Status:** APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

**Deployment Strategy:**
1. Deploy to canary instances (10% traffic)
2. Monitor for 24 hours (latency, errors, arena stats)
3. Expand to 50% traffic
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Full rollout to 100%

**Rollback Criteria:**
- Error rate increase >0.5%
- Latency p99 increase >10%
- Arena overflow rate >1%
- Any correctness issue

**Expected Impact:**
- Query latency p99: 2.1ms → 1.8ms (15% reduction)
- Consolidation cycle time: 2.5ms → 2.0ms (20% reduction)
- No change to error rates or correctness

Milestone 10 complete. Zig kernels ready for production.
