# Performance Regression Framework - Perspectives

## Systems Architecture Perspective

Performance regressions are insidious. They don't cause crashes or test failures. They silently accumulate until your system is 2x slower than six months ago, and nobody knows why.

Automated regression detection treats performance as a first-class correctness property. If a PR makes vector similarity 6% slower, the build fails. Same as if it broke a unit test.

This shifts mindset from "performance is nice to have" to "performance is required."

## Testing and Validation Perspective

You can't manage what you don't measure. Performance regression frameworks measure continuously:

- Every commit: Is this change slower?
- Every sprint: Are we trending slower?
- Every quarter: Are we meeting SLAs?

Without automation, performance testing happens sporadically before releases. Bugs are caught late when they're expensive to fix.

With automation, regressions are caught immediately when the bad commit lands.

## Rust Graph Engine Perspective

Zig kernels promise 15-35% performance improvements. How do we prevent future changes from erasing those gains?

Regression framework provides guardrails:
1. Baseline: Vector similarity runs in 1.7μs
2. PR adds logging: Benchmark shows 1.9μs (12% regression)
3. Build fails: "Performance regression detected"
4. Developer investigates: Logging on hot path
5. Fix: Move logging off hot path
6. Benchmark: 1.7μs again
7. Build passes

Without automation, the regression ships. With automation, it's caught pre-merge.
