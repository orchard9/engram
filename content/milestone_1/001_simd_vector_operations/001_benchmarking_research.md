## Research Findings Section

### 1. Statistical Rigor in Performance Benchmarking

**G*Power and Sample Size Determination**:
G*Power is a comprehensive software tool for power analysis and sample size calculation that supports F, t, χ2, Z, and exact tests. The software enables researchers to perform a priori analyses (sample size calculation before conducting studies) based on effect size, desired α level, and power level (1-β). Key findings include:

- **A priori analysis** is the most common type, determining necessary sample size N before study conduct
- **Four key factors** affect statistical power: sample size (larger = greater power), effect size (larger differences = more power), alpha level (lower α = decreased power), and statistical test choice
- **Evidence-based effect sizes** should be derived from published papers in similar research domains
- **Practical rule**: The process combines statistical analysis, subject-area knowledge, and specific requirements to find optimal sample size

**Multiple Testing Corrections**:
Research reveals significant differences between correction methods for performance benchmarking:

- **Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) FDR Method**: Controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) rather than Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), providing higher power than Bonferroni corrections. Less sensitive to decisions about test "families" and maintains consistent rejection rates when test numbers vary.
- **Holm-Bonferroni Method**: Based on Bonferroni but less conservative, computing significance levels in stepwise fashion based on P-value ranks.
- **Performance Trade-offs**: BH offers greater power for detecting true effects while allowing controlled proportion of false discoveries. Bonferroni methods provide stricter control of any false positives.
- **Scalability**: BH maintains same proportion of significant results as test numbers increase, making it more robust for varying benchmark suites.

### 2. Formal Verification in Cognitive Computing

**SMT Solvers for Cognitive Systems**:
SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers like Z3 and CVC5 provide automated reasoning for complex logical formulas, essential for cognitive system verification:

- **Z3 Theorem Prover**: Microsoft Research SMT solver supporting arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, datatypes, uninterpreted functions, and quantifiers. Main applications include static checking, test case generation, and predicate abstraction.
- **CVC5**: Latest SMT solver building on CVC4 codebase, described as "versatile and industrial-strength" with performance evaluations against Z3 and CVC4.
- **Applications in Verification**: Program verification tools (Boogie, VCC, Dafny), symbolic execution for security vulnerability detection (SAGE, KLEE), and smart contract verification.
- **Industrial Impact**: Z3 used in Windows 7 static driver verifier, SAGE white-box fuzzer, and Verve verified operating system kernel.

**Property Testing Integration**:
SMT solvers answer satisfiability questions for Boolean formulas in specialized theories (Integers, Reals, Arrays), providing responses of satisfiable, unsatisfiable, or unknown. The verification targets include arithmetic overflow/underflow, division by zero, unreachable code, and bounds checking.

### 3. Metamorphic Testing for Cognitive Systems

**Fundamentals and Mathematical Invariants**:
Metamorphic testing addresses the test oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) - necessary properties involving multiple software executions based on mathematical invariants:

- **Core Principle**: Instead of knowing expected outputs, test relationships between inputs/outputs. Example: sin(π - x) = sin(x) allows verification without knowing exact sine values.
- **Relation Types**: Invariance (output unchanged after perturbation), Increasing (output increases), Decreasing (output decreases).
- **Research Impact**: Over 750 papers published since inception, covering web services, machine learning, bioinformatics, numerical analysis, and quantum computing.

**Applications in Cognitive Algorithms**:
Particularly valuable for machine learning and cognitive systems where test oracles are unavailable:

- **ML Algorithm Testing**: Applied to k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes classifiers, supervised learning systems.
- **Dual Purpose**: Serves both verification (implementation correctness) and validation (algorithm appropriateness for problem domain).
- **Quality Assurance**: Addresses oracle problem for scientific computing software depending on ML classification algorithms.

### 4. Cognitive Plausibility Validation

**DRM False Memory Paradigm**:
The Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm provides standardized cognitive benchmarking for memory systems:

- **Procedure**: Subjects hear semantically related word lists (e.g., nurse, hospital) then recall words, often falsely remembering related but absent "lure" words (e.g., sleep) with same frequency as presented words.
- **Individual Differences**: Higher need for cognition correlates with more false recognition. Better semantic memory abilities correlate with more false memories, while better episodic abilities correlate with fewer false memories.
- **Validation Applications**: Demonstrates constructive, adaptive nature of memory. False memory effects show robustness across short (immediate, 20 min) and long (1, 7, 60 day) delays.
- **Measurement Tools**: Drift diffusion accumulation model uses recognition responses and latencies to estimate drift rate (evidence accumulation) and boundary separation (memory evidence threshold).

**Adaptive Memory Processing**:
DRM illusions based on semantic memory network activation may be functionally useful, as remembering gist rather than details is arguably adaptive. The paradigm's simplicity and short duration make it valuable for probing stereotypes, addiction thought processes, and amnesia impairments.
