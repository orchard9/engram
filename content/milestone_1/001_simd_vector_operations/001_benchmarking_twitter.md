# Twitter Thread: Testing Memory Like a Brain

## Thread 1/10
Most AI systems test for mathematical correctness. Engram tests for something much more interesting: does it think like a human? 

Traditional benchmarking asks "is the answer right?" Cognitive benchmarking asks "is the answer humanly right?" 

Here's why that matters ðŸ§µ

## Thread 2/10
The "oracle problem": In traditional AI, you know the right answer. 2+2=4, period.

But what's the "right" way for a memory system to forget? What's the "correct" false memory to generate?

Psychology research gives us these answers. AI benchmarking has ignored them. Until now.

## Thread 3/10
Example: The DRM false memory paradigm. Show humans word lists about hospitals (doctor, medicine, patient, sick) and they'll "remember" hearing "nurse" - even when it was never spoken.

This isn't a bug in human memory. It's a feature. It's how we complete patterns and understand context.

## Thread 4/10
Traditional vector databases would call this a hallucination error. 

Engram's benchmarking validates that it exhibits the RIGHT KIND of "errors" - the constructive memory processes that make human cognition so powerful.

Testing for psychological realism, not mathematical perfection.

## Thread 5/10
The statistical rigor is wild:

â€¢ G*Power analysis: Calculate exact sample sizes for 99.5% confidence in detecting 5% performance regressions
â€¢ Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction: Control false discoveries across dozens of cognitive phenomena
â€¢ Effect size analysis: Distinguish meaningful changes from statistical noise

## Thread 6/10
Metamorphic testing solves the "no ground truth" problem brilliantly.

Instead of knowing exact answers, test relationships:
- sin(Ï€-x) = sin(x) 
- Strengthening memory A shouldn't hurt retrieval of unrelated memory B
- Scale invariance in similarity judgments

Test invariants, not outputs.

## Thread 7/10
The formal verification piece is genuinely impressive:

4 SMT solvers (Z3, CVC5, Yices, MathSAT) prove mathematical properties of cognitive algorithms. Not just "does it work" but "mathematically guaranteed to work correctly under all conditions."

Formal proofs about psychological phenomena.

## Thread 8/10
Hardware optimization meets psychology:

SIMD implementations tested across AVX-512, AVX2, NEON to ensure 8x speedups don't break human-like similarity judgments.

Performance optimizations must preserve cognitive plausibility. Three-way constraint satisfaction: fast, correct, AND human-like.

## Thread 9/10
Real impact: AI systems that are intelligible, not just intelligent.

When you ask about "Q3 strategy meeting," you want related context like "budget discussions" even if those exact words don't appear in your query.

Cognitive architectures understand this. Vector databases don't.

## Thread 10/10
This is bigger than just Engram. It's establishing standards for validating ANY AI system that claims to be "cognitive" or "brain-inspired."

Just as compilers need formal verification and drugs need clinical trials, cognitive AI needs psychological validation.

The future of human-AI collaboration depends on it.
