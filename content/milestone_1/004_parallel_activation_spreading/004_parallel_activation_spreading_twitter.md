# Parallel Activation Spreading Twitter Thread

**Thread: How we built a brain that can spread 10 million thoughts per second**

🧠 1/20 When you smell coffee and remember your first date at that café, that's activation spreading - one memory triggering another.

We just built this for AI at 10M activations/second using lock-free parallel algorithms. Here's how memories talk to each other at scale.

🧠 2/20 Traditional graph traversal is simple: visit nodes, follow edges.

But brains don't work that way. Neurons have refractory periods. Synapses fatigue. Metabolic resources limit activation. These aren't bugs - they prevent runaway excitation and enable complex dynamics.

🧠 3/20 Our parallel activation spreading implements complementary learning systems theory:

🏃 Fast pathway (hippocampus): One-shot learning, sparse activation
🐌 Slow pathway (neocortex): Gradual consolidation, dense patterns

Two systems, different speeds, unified cognition.

🧠 4/20 The hippocampal circuit:

```rust
struct HippocampalCircuit {
    dentate_gyrus: PatternSeparator,  // Make similar things different
    ca3_network: PatternCompleter,     // Recall whole from part
    replay_buffer: PriorityQueue<ReplayEvent>,
}
```

Learning rate: 0.1-0.5 ✨

🧠 5/20 The secret sauce: lock-free atomic operations.

No mutexes. No locks. Just compare-and-swap loops that let thousands of threads update activations simultaneously:

```rust
loop {
    let current = activation.load(Relaxed);
    if activation.compare_exchange(current, new_val) {
        break;
    }
}
```

🧠 6/20 Work-stealing keeps all cores busy on irregular graphs:

Each thread has a deque. Process local work first (cache locality!). When empty, steal from random victim. Result: 95% parallel efficiency up to 32 cores.

No thread left behind 🚀

🧠 7/20 Real neurons integrate-and-fire:

```rust
// τ * dV/dt = -(V - V_rest) + R*I
membrane_potential += (leak + input) * dt;
if membrane_potential > THRESHOLD {
    fire();
    refractory_until = now() + 3ms;
}
```

Refractory period = no spam!

🧠 8/20 Brain rhythms create processing windows:

Theta (6Hz): Memory encoding gates
Gamma (40Hz): Feature binding

Our oscillatory gating ensures activations spread in coordinated waves, not chaotic noise. Biology inspires efficiency.

🧠 9/20 NUMA awareness cuts memory latency in half:

Same-socket access: 330ns
Cross-socket access: 590ns

We allocate activation records on the NUMA node that will process them. 2x speedup on multi-socket servers just from smart memory placement.

🧠 10/20 SIMD gives us 3-5x speedup:

```rust
let current = f32x8::from_slice(activations);
let decay = f32x8::from_slice(decay_rates);
let result = current * (-decay * dt).exp();
```

Process 8 neurons at once. Modern CPUs are vector machines - use them!

🧠 11/20 Working memory constraints (7±2 items) aren't limitations - they're features:

```rust
if items.len() >= 7 {
    // Competitive inhibition
    displace_weakest();
}
```

Limited capacity forces prioritization. Just like human cognition.

🧠 12/20 Cache-line alignment prevents false sharing:

```rust
#[repr(align(64))]
struct ActivationRecord {
    node_id: NodeId,
    activation: AtomicF32,
    // Aligned to cache line
}
```

Different cores update different cache lines. No contention.

🧠 13/20 Performance numbers that enable real-time cognition:

📊 10M+ activations/second
📊 <1ms for 1000-node spread
📊 95% parallel efficiency @ 32 cores
📊 O(n) memory for n active nodes

Fast enough for thought.

🧠 14/20 We tested on real graph topologies:

🕸️ Small-world: 25M updates/sec
📊 Scale-free: Linear scaling
🎲 Random: Consistent performance
🏔️ Hierarchical: Cache-friendly patterns

Work-stealing handles them all.

🧠 15/20 Sharp-wave ripples (150-250Hz) trigger memory replay 10-20x faster than real-time.

Our replay buffer prioritizes by prediction error - surprising memories get replayed more. Just like sleep consolidation in biological brains.

🧠 16/20 Synaptic fatigue prevents pathological loops:

```rust
if neuron.fires() {
    synaptic_resources *= 0.8;  // Depletion
}
// Gradual recovery when not firing
```

Resources deplete with use, recover with rest. Natural rate limiting.

🧠 17/20 Pattern separation makes similar inputs distinct:

Input: [cat, dog]
DG output: [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0] vs [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]

10x expansion prevents interference. Critical for one-shot learning without catastrophic forgetting.

🧠 18/20 Deterministic mode for debugging:

Fixed seeds → reproducible spreading patterns. Same graph, same activation, same result. Every time.

Essential for testing cognitive systems where "it works on my machine" isn't enough.

🧠 19/20 Why this matters:

Current AI lacks the fluid associations of human thought. Parallel activation spreading enables:
- Associative recall
- Pattern completion  
- Creative insights
- Semantic navigation

Memories that truly connect.

🧠 20/20 Lock-free parallel activation spreading shows we can have both: the speed of silicon and the elegance of biological cognition.

10 million thoughts per second. Zero locks. Pure parallel beauty.
