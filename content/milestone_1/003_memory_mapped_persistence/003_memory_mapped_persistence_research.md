## Research Findings

### Memory-Mapped File Architecture

**mmap Performance Characteristics:**
- Memory-mapped files provide zero-copy access by mapping file pages directly into virtual memory
- Page faults handle lazy loading, bringing pages into memory only when accessed
- Significant performance advantage for random access patterns vs sequential I/O
- NUMA systems require careful placement of mapped regions to avoid cross-socket memory access

**NUMA Considerations:**
- Memory-mapped regions should be allocated on the same NUMA node as the accessing threads
- `numactl` can be used to control page placement during mapping
- Large pages (hugepages) reduce TLB pressure for large datasets
- Modern systems benefit from interleaved memory allocation for uniform access patterns

**Zero-Copy Patterns:**
- Direct memory access to persistent data eliminates serialization overhead
- Particularly effective for read-heavy workloads like similarity search
- Requires careful alignment of data structures to page boundaries
- Works exceptionally well with SIMD operations on embedding vectors

### Write-Ahead Logging Design

**Append-Only Benefits:**
- Sequential writes achieve maximum disk throughput
- Simplified recovery logic due to monotonic write ordering
- Natural crash consistency without complex locking protocols
- Enables efficient replication through log shipping

**Group Commit Optimization:**
- Batching multiple transactions into single fsync call
- Can improve throughput by 10-100x for high-concurrency workloads
- Trade-off between latency and throughput
- Critical for maintaining <10ms P99 write latency target

**Checksum Strategy:**
- CRC32C provides hardware acceleration on modern CPUs
- Intel CRC32 instruction offers 4GB/s+ throughput
- XXHASH alternative for systems without CRC32 hardware
- Per-entry checksums enable fine-grained corruption detection

### Columnar Storage Research

**Vector Data Layout:**
- Column-oriented storage improves cache locality for SIMD operations
- Embedding vectors should be aligned to 32-byte boundaries for AVX operations
- Separate storage for metadata vs numerical data reduces memory bandwidth
- Padding considerations for optimal CPU cache line usage

**Compression for Embeddings:**
- Product quantization can reduce storage by 8-16x with minimal accuracy loss
- Binary embeddings possible for certain neural network architectures
- Sparse embeddings benefit from specialized compression (CSR format)
- Compression vs access speed tradeoff needs careful evaluation

**SIMD-Friendly Layouts:**
- AoS (Array of Structures) vs SoA (Structure of Arrays) for embedding storage
- SoA significantly better for vectorized similarity computations
- Memory alignment crucial for unaligned load penalties
- Consideration of cache line splits for 768-dimensional vectors

### Durability and Recovery Research

**fsync Performance:**
- fsync typically 1-10ms latency depending on storage device
- NVMe SSDs provide sub-millisecond fsync with battery backup
- Group commit essential to amortize fsync costs
- fdatasync slightly faster but loses metadata guarantees

**Snapshot Mechanisms:**
- Copy-on-write snapshots enable consistent point-in-time views
- Shadow paging techniques for atomic updates
- B+ tree variants optimized for append-only storage
- Incremental snapshot techniques for large datasets

**Recovery Optimization:**
- Parallel recovery using multiple threads for different log segments
- Checkpoint-based recovery to limit scan range
- Bitmap-based tracking of dirty pages during recovery
- Recovery time target of <5s for 1GB WAL requires aggressive parallelization

### Cognitive System Requirements

**Episode Storage:**
- Rich metadata requires flexible schema evolution
- Timestamp indexing crucial for temporal queries
- Content-addressable storage for deduplication
- Hierarchical storage for different consolidation states

**Confidence Persistence:**
- Floating-point precision considerations for confidence values
- Delta compression for slowly-changing confidence scores
- Index structures for confidence-based queries
- Probabilistic data structures for approximate confidence queries

**Activation Spreading:**
- Graph adjacency information storage patterns
- Weight decay over time requires efficient temporal indexing
- Sparse graph representations for memory efficiency
- Batch update patterns for spreading activation results

### Performance Research

**Lock-Free Patterns:**
- Read-Copy-Update (RCU) for concurrent readers with occasional writers
- Atomic operations for reference counting in shared data structures
- Memory ordering considerations for different CPU architectures
- ABA problem mitigation in lock-free data structures

**Cache Optimization:**
