# Production Monitoring Research for Engram

## Lock-Free Data Structures for Metrics Collection

### Research Topics
1. **Wait-free vs Lock-free Guarantees**
   - Wait-free: Every thread completes in bounded steps regardless of other threads
   - Lock-free: At least one thread makes progress (system-wide progress)
   - Obstruction-free: Thread makes progress when running alone
   - Engram choice: Lock-free for counters, wait-free for critical paths

2. **Atomic Operations and Memory Ordering**
   - `Ordering::Relaxed`: No synchronization, only atomicity (fastest, ~5ns)
   - `Ordering::Acquire/Release`: Establishes happens-before relationships (~10ns)
   - `Ordering::SeqCst`: Total ordering across all threads (~20ns)
   - Research: "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" (Herlihy & Shavit, 2012)
   - Engram approach: Relaxed for counters, Acquire/Release for aggregation

3. **Cache Line Alignment and False Sharing**
   - Modern CPUs: 64-byte cache lines (Intel x86_64, ARM64)
   - False sharing: Multiple threads updating different data in same cache line
   - Performance impact: 10-100x slowdown from cache coherence traffic
   - Solution: `#[repr(align(64))]` and `CachePadded` types
   - Research: "What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory" (Drepper, 2007)

4. **Hazard Pointers and Epoch-Based Reclamation**
   - Problem: Safe memory reclamation in lock-free structures
   - Hazard pointers: Threads announce which nodes they're accessing
   - Epoch-based: Grace periods for safe reclamation (crossbeam-epoch)
   - Trade-offs: Hazard pointers more precise, epochs simpler
