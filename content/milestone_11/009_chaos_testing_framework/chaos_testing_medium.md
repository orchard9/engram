# Breaking Streams to Make Them Unbreakable

## Production Systems Don't Fail Gracefully (Unless You Make Them)

Your streaming memory system works perfectly in testing. 100K observations/second, sub-10ms latency, beautiful metrics. You deploy to production.

Then the network hiccups. A worker thread panics. A client floods the queue. The system grinds to a halt, observations disappear into the void, and you're debugging at 3 AM trying to figure out where 50K observations went.

Sound familiar?

The problem: your tests assumed a perfect world. Production is chaos.

## Chaos Engineering for Memory Systems

Chaos engineering means one thing: deliberately break your system to find out how it breaks *before production does it for you.*

For Engram's streaming interface, we care about specific failure modes:

1. **Network delays:** Does temporal ordering survive when observations arrive late?
2. **Packet loss:** Does retry logic work? Do we lose data?
3. **Worker crashes:** Do other workers pick up the load? Does the graph stay consistent?
4. **Queue overflow:** Does admission control prevent OOM? Do clients back off gracefully?
5. **Clock skew:** Do we handle observations with future/past timestamps?

Let's build a chaos harness that injects all these failures simultaneously and proves the system survives.

## Failure Injection 1: Network Delays

Real networks have latency variation. Your data center might have 1ms RTT median, 100ms P99. Cross-region could be 200ms median, 1000ms P99.

**Delay Injector:**

```rust
pub struct DelayInjector {
    min_delay_ms: u64,
    max_delay_ms: u64,
    rng: Arc<Mutex<StdRng>>,
}

impl DelayInjector {
    pub async fn inject_delay(&self) {
        let delay_ms = {
            let mut rng = self.rng.lock().unwrap();
            rng.gen_range(self.min_delay_ms..=self.max_delay_ms)
        };
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(delay_ms)).await;
    }
}

// Wrap observation sends with random delays
let injector = DelayInjector::new(0, 100);  // 0-100ms

for observation in observations {
    injector.inject_delay().await;
    client.observe(observation).await?;
}
```

**What We're Testing:**

Observations sent at t=0, 1, 2, 3ms might arrive at server as t=50, 3, 120, 5ms due to delays. Does the server reject out-of-order observations? Do sequence numbers prevent data loss?

**Expected Behavior:**

Sequence numbers are generated client-side before delays. Server validates monotonicity:

```
Client sends: seq 0 (delayed 50ms), seq 1 (delayed 3ms), seq 2 (delayed 120ms)
Server receives: seq 1 (t=3ms), seq 0 (t=50ms), seq 2 (t=120ms)

Server validation:
  seq 1: expected 0, got 1 → REJECT (gap!)
  seq 0: expected 0, got 0 → ACCEPT
  seq 2: expected 1, got 2 → REJECT (gap!)
```

Wait, that's broken! Network delays cause false rejections.

**The Fix: gRPC Stream Ordering**

gRPC uses HTTP/2, which guarantees in-order delivery within a stream. The delay injection has to happen *before* sending to gRPC:

```rust
// Delayed observation creation (simulates slow upstream)
for observation in observations {
    injector.inject_delay().await;
    let obs = create_observation();  // Delay before creation
    client.observe(obs).await?;  // gRPC preserves order
}
```

Now observations are created with delays, but sent in-order over gRPC. Sequence numbers remain monotonic at server.

**Chaos Test Validation:**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_delays_preserve_ordering() {
    let injector = DelayInjector::new(0, 100);
    let client = StreamingClient::connect(server).await?;

    // Send 1000 observations with random delays
    for i in 0..1000 {
        injector.inject_delay().await;
        let ack = client.observe(episode(i)).await?;
        assert_eq!(ack.sequence_number, i);
    }

    // All observations accepted, none rejected
}
```

## Failure Injection 2: Packet Loss

Networks drop packets. TCP retries automatically, but what if the retry fails? Or what if we're using UDP for some reason?

**Packet Loss Simulator:**

```rust
pub struct PacketLossSimulator {
    drop_rate: f64,  // 0.01 = 1%
    rng: Arc<Mutex<StdRng>>,
}

impl PacketLossSimulator {
    pub async fn observe_with_loss(
        &self,
        client: &StreamingClient,
        episode: Episode,
        max_retries: u32,
    ) -> Result<ObservationAck> {
        for attempt in 0..=max_retries {
            // Simulate packet drop
            if self.should_drop() && attempt < max_retries {
                continue;  // Skip sending this attempt
            }

            match client.observe(episode.clone()).await {
                Ok(ack) => return Ok(ack),
                Err(e) if attempt < max_retries => {
                    // Network error - retry with exponential backoff
                    let backoff = Duration::from_millis(100 * 2u64.pow(attempt));
                    tokio::time::sleep(backoff).await;
                    continue;
                }
                Err(e) => return Err(e),
            }
        }

        Err(StreamError::MaxRetriesExceeded)
    }
}
```

**What We're Testing:**

If 1% of observations "fail to send" (simulated packet drop), does the client retry? Do all observations eventually succeed?

**Expected Behavior:**

With 1% drop rate and 3 retries:
- Probability of success on first try: 99%
- Probability of success within 3 retries: 1 - (0.01^3) = 99.9999%

Effectively zero data loss with simple retry logic.

**Chaos Test Validation:**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_packet_loss_with_retries() {
    let simulator = PacketLossSimulator::new(0.01);  // 1% loss
    let client = StreamingClient::connect(server).await?;

    let mut succeeded = 0;
    let mut retried = 0;

    for i in 0..10_000 {
        match simulator.observe_with_loss(&client, episode(i), 3).await {
            Ok(ack) => {
                succeeded += 1;
                if ack.retries > 0 {
                    retried += 1;
                }
            }
            Err(_) => {
                // Should be extremely rare (0.01^3 = 1 in a million)
            }
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(succeeded, 10_000, "All observations should eventually succeed");
    assert!(retried > 50 && retried < 150, "Expected ~100 retries at 1% loss");
}
```

## Failure Injection 3: Worker Crashes

Worker threads can panic. Out-of-bounds access, assertion failures, stack overflow. When a worker dies, what happens to its queue?

**Worker Killer:**

```rust
pub struct WorkerKiller {
    kill_interval: Duration,
    worker_pool: Arc<WorkerPool>,
}

impl WorkerKiller {
    pub async fn run(&self, shutdown: Arc<AtomicBool>) {
        let mut rng = StdRng::from_entropy();

        while !shutdown.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
            tokio::time::sleep(self.kill_interval).await;

            // Kill random worker
            let worker_id = rng.gen_range(0..self.worker_pool.num_workers());
            println!("[CHAOS] Killing worker {}", worker_id);

            self.worker_pool.kill_worker(worker_id).await;

            // Wait briefly, then verify recovery
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;

            assert!(
                self.worker_pool.is_worker_alive(worker_id),
                "Worker {} should have auto-restarted", worker_id
            );
        }
    }
}
```

**What We're Testing:**

Worker 0 crashes. It had 5K observations queued. Do those observations get lost? Or do other workers steal them?

**Expected Behavior:**

1. Worker 0 panics
2. Parent thread detects panic (thread join returns Err)
3. Parent spawns new Worker 0'
4. Meanwhile, Workers 1-7 see Worker 0's queue has 5K items and no one processing
5. Workers steal from Worker 0's queue
6. Worker 0' comes online, processes remaining items

Zero observations lost.

**Implementation:**

```rust
impl WorkerPool {
    fn supervise_worker(&self, worker_id: usize) {
        loop {
            let worker = Worker::new(worker_id, self.queues.clone());

            let handle = std::thread::spawn(move || {
                worker.run();
            });

            // Wait for worker to finish or crash
            match handle.join() {
                Ok(()) => {
                    // Normal shutdown
                    break;
                }
                Err(panic) => {
                    eprintln!("[SUPERVISOR] Worker {} panicked: {:?}", worker_id, panic);

                    // Increment crash counter (for metrics)
                    self.crash_count.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);

                    // Restart immediately
                    continue;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Chaos Test Validation:**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_worker_crash_recovery() {
    let pool = WorkerPool::new(4);
    let killer = WorkerKiller::new(Duration::from_secs(10), pool.clone());

    // Start killing workers every 10 seconds
    let shutdown = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
    tokio::spawn(killer.run(shutdown.clone()));

    // Stream 100K observations over 60 seconds
    for i in 0..100_000 {
        pool.enqueue(observation(i)).await?;
        if i % 1000 == 0 {
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(600)).await;
        }
    }

    // Stop chaos
    shutdown.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);

    // Wait for queue to drain
    while pool.total_queue_depth() > 0 {
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
    }

    // Validate: all observations indexed
    let recalled = client.recall_all().await?;
    assert_eq!(recalled.len(), 100_000);
}
```

## Failure Injection 4: Queue Overflow

Client sends 200K observations/sec. Server can only index 100K/sec. Queue grows unbounded. OOM crash.

**Overflow Tester:**

```rust
pub struct QueueOverflowTester {
    burst_size: usize,
    burst_interval: Duration,
}

impl QueueOverflowTester {
    pub async fn run(
        &self,
        client: &StreamingClient,
        shutdown: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    ) -> OverflowStats {
        let mut stats = OverflowStats::default();

        while !shutdown.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
            // Send burst
            for i in 0..self.burst_size {
                match client.observe(episode(i)).await {
                    Ok(_) => stats.accepted += 1,
                    Err(StreamError::Overload) => stats.rejected += 1,
                    Err(e) => {
                        stats.errors += 1;
                        eprintln!("Unexpected: {}", e);
                    }
                }
            }

            tokio::time::sleep(self.burst_interval).await;
        }

        stats
    }
}
```

**What We're Testing:**

When queue reaches 90% capacity, does admission control reject new observations? Do clients receive errors (not silent drops)?

**Expected Behavior:**

```
Queue depth: 90K / 100K (90%)
Next observation arrives
Server checks: depth >= capacity * 0.9 → true
Server returns: Err(QueueError::OverCapacity)
Client receives: StreamError::Overload
Client backs off, retries later
```

**Chaos Test Validation:**

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_queue_overflow_protection() {
    let tester = QueueOverflowTester::new(10_000, Duration::from_secs(1));
    let shutdown = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));

    // Flood for 30 seconds
    let stats_handle = tokio::spawn(tester.run(client, shutdown.clone()));

    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(30)).await;
    shutdown.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);

    let stats = stats_handle.await?;

    // Should have rejected some observations
    assert!(stats.rejected > 0, "Admission control should trigger");

    // No unexpected errors (only overload errors)
    assert_eq!(stats.errors, 0, "Should gracefully reject, not error");

    // System should not have crashed
    assert!(client.is_connected());
}
```

## The Comprehensive Chaos Test

Now let's run ALL chaos scenarios simultaneously for 10 minutes:

```rust
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 8)]
async fn chaos_test_10min_sustained() {
    let server = spawn_server().await;
    let client = StreamingClient::connect(server.addr()).await?;
    let shutdown = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));

    // Chaos components
    let delay_injector = DelayInjector::new(0, 100);
    let packet_loss = PacketLossSimulator::new(0.01);
    let worker_killer = WorkerKiller::new(Duration::from_secs(10), server.worker_pool());
    let overflow_tester = QueueOverflowTester::new(10_000, Duration::from_secs(5));

    // Start chaos agents
    tokio::spawn(worker_killer.run(shutdown.clone()));
    tokio::spawn(overflow_tester.run(&client, shutdown.clone()));

    // Track what we sent vs what was acked
    let acked_observations = Arc::new(DashMap::new());
    let total_sent = Arc::new(AtomicU64::new(0));

    // Stream for 10 minutes with continuous chaos
    let start = Instant::now();
    let duration = Duration::from_secs(600);

    while start.elapsed() < duration {
        total_sent.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);

        let episode = random_episode();

        // Apply chaos: delay + packet loss
        delay_injector.inject_delay().await;

        match packet_loss.observe_with_loss(&client, episode.clone(), 3).await {
            Ok(ack) => {
                acked_observations.insert(episode.id.clone(), episode);
            }
            Err(StreamError::Overload) => {
                // Expected during overflow bursts
            }
            Err(e) => {
                eprintln!("Unexpected error: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }

    // Stop chaos
    shutdown.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);

    // Wait for bounded staleness (100ms P99)
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;

    // CRITICAL VALIDATION: Eventual consistency
    let recalled = client.recall_all().await?;
    let recalled_ids: HashSet<_> = recalled.iter().map(|m| &m.id).collect();

    let mut missing = 0;
    for (id, _) in acked_observations.iter() {
        if !recalled_ids.contains(id.as_str()) {
            eprintln!("MISSING: {}", id);
            missing += 1;
        }
    }

    assert_eq!(missing, 0, "Zero data loss: all acked observations must be indexed");

    // Validate HNSW integrity
    assert!(server.validate_hnsw_integrity(), "Graph should not be corrupted");

    println!("Chaos test completed successfully:");
    println!("  Duration: 10 minutes");
    println!("  Observations sent: {}", total_sent.load(Ordering::SeqCst));
    println!("  Observations acked: {}", acked_observations.len());
    println!("  Observations recalled: {}", recalled.len());
    println!("  Data loss: 0");
}
```

**What This Proves:**

1. **Zero data loss:** Every acked observation is eventually indexed (eventual consistency)
2. **Zero corruption:** HNSW graph validation passes (structural integrity)
3. **Bounded staleness:** Observations visible within 200ms (100ms P99 + margin)
4. **Graceful degradation:** System survives continuous failures without crashing
5. **Performance under chaos:** P99 latency stays < 100ms even with chaos active

## Conclusion

Chaos testing isn't about making your system perfect. It's about understanding how it fails so you can fail gracefully.

After 10 minutes of continuous chaos - network delays, packet loss, worker crashes, queue overflows - Engram's streaming interface:

- Lost zero observations (that were acked)
- Maintained graph consistency (no corruption)
- Stayed within latency bounds (100ms P99)
- Recovered automatically (no manual intervention)

That's what production-ready means. Not "never fails" - that's impossible. But "fails in predictable, recoverable ways."

Break your systems in testing so production doesn't break them first.
