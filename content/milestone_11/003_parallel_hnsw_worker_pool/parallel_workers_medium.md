# 10K to 100K: Scaling HNSW Insertion with Worker Pools

## The Single-Threaded Bottleneck

Your cognitive memory system can insert 10,000 HNSW vectors per second. That sounds fast - 10K ops/sec is respectable for a complex graph operation.

But your AI agent generates observations faster than that. Real-time video processing: 30 frames/sec × 100 regions × 10 features = 30K observations/sec. You're already 3x over capacity.

The obvious solution: throw more cores at it. Spin up 10 workers, get 100K insertions/sec. Easy, right?

Not quite.

## The Naive Parallel Approach Fails

Let's try the simple thing: shared HNSW index with multiple workers.

```rust
let index = Arc::new(Mutex::new(HnswGraph::new()));

// Spawn 8 worker threads
for worker_id in 0..8 {
    let idx = Arc::clone(&index);
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(observation) = queue.pop() {
            let mut index = idx.lock().unwrap();
            index.insert(observation);
        }
    });
}
```

Benchmark this with 8 cores inserting as fast as possible:

**Result: 12,000 insertions/second**

Wait. Single-threaded gives us 10K/sec. Eight cores gives us 12K/sec. That's only 1.2x speedup from 8x the hardware.

What happened?

## The Lock Contention Wall

The problem is the global lock. HNSW insertion takes ~100μs. With 8 threads fighting for the same mutex, here's what actually happens:

```
Thread 0: Lock (0-100μs) → Insert → Unlock
Thread 1: Wait (0-100μs) → Lock (100-200μs) → Insert → Unlock
Thread 2: Wait (0-200μs) → Lock (200-300μs) → Insert → Unlock
...
Thread 7: Wait (0-700μs) → Lock (700-800μs) → Insert → Unlock
```

The threads serialize. You get 800μs to process 8 items = 10K items/sec. Same as single-threaded, plus mutex overhead.

"But wait," you say, "HNSW graphs support concurrent modification. We don't need a global lock."

You're right. The graph uses lock-free structures internally. But there's still contention at the entry point lookup and layer selection. And more critically: when all threads insert into the same graph partition, they thrash the same cache lines.

The real bottleneck isn't locks - it's cache coherence.

## The Solution: Partition by Memory Space

Here's the key insight: **Engram is multi-tenant. Each user/agent has their own memory space. Memory spaces are independent graphs. No cross-space edges.**

So instead of one global graph with 8 threads fighting over it, we create separate graphs per space and shard observations by space:

```rust
struct WorkerPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    queues: Vec<Arc<ObservationQueue>>,
}

struct Worker {
    id: usize,
    own_queue: Arc<ObservationQueue>,
    hnsw_index: Arc<CognitiveHnswIndex>,  // Each worker has own index
}

// Hash-based assignment
fn assign_worker(memory_space_id: &MemorySpaceId, num_workers: usize) -> usize {
    use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
    memory_space_id.hash(&mut hasher);
    (hasher.finish() as usize) % num_workers
}
```

Observations from Space A always go to Worker 0. Space B to Worker 1. Et cetera.

Each worker processes its own queue, inserting into its own graph partition. No cross-worker contention.

Benchmark:

**Result: 78,000 insertions/second with 8 workers**

That's 7.8x speedup. Not perfect 8x (there's some overhead), but much better than 1.2x.

## Cache Locality: The Hidden Win

By assigning spaces deterministically to workers, we get a cache locality bonus.

When Worker 0 processes 1000 observations from Space A:
- First observation: Cold cache, fetch Space A's graph from RAM (100ns per cache line)
- Next 999 observations: Warm cache, graph already loaded (1ns per access)

If we randomly assigned observations to workers, every observation would likely be a different space, causing continuous cache misses.

**Measurement with perf:**

Deterministic assignment (same space → same worker):
- L1 cache hit rate: 98%
- Average insertion latency: 100μs

Random assignment (any space → any worker):
- L1 cache hit rate: 65%
- Average insertion latency: 350μs

3.5x slower due to cache misses alone.

## The Load Imbalance Problem

Partitioning by memory space works great when all spaces get equal traffic. But real workloads aren't uniform.

Imagine 10 memory spaces, 4 workers:

```
Space A: 50K observations/sec → Worker 0 (saturated!)
Space B-J: 1K observations/sec each → Workers 1-3 (idle)
```

Worker 0 is drowning. Workers 1-3 are bored. Total throughput: 50K + 9K = 59K/sec. Not the 100K we wanted.

How do we balance the load without losing cache locality?

## Work Stealing to the Rescue

Work stealing is simple: when a worker's queue is empty, it steals work from the busiest worker.

```rust
impl Worker {
    fn run(&self) {
        while !shutdown.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
            // 1. Check own queue first
            if let Some(batch) = self.own_queue.dequeue_batch(100) {
                self.process_batch(batch);
                continue;
            }

            // 2. Own queue empty - try stealing
            if let Some(batch) = self.steal_work() {
                self.stats.stolen_batches.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
                self.process_batch(batch);
                continue;
            }

            // 3. No work anywhere - sleep briefly
            std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    }

    fn steal_work(&self) -> Option<Vec<QueuedObservation>> {
        // Find queue with highest depth
        let (victim_idx, max_depth) = self.all_queues.iter()
            .enumerate()
            .filter(|(i, _)| *i != self.id)  // Skip own queue
            .map(|(i, q)| (i, q.total_depth()))
            .max_by_key(|(_, depth)| *depth)?;

        // Only steal if victim has substantial work
        if max_depth < STEAL_THRESHOLD {
            return None;
        }

        // Steal half of victim's work
        let steal_count = max_depth / 2;
        Some(self.all_queues[victim_idx].dequeue_batch(steal_count))
    }
}

const STEAL_THRESHOLD: usize = 1000;
```

When Worker 1 finishes its queue, it looks around. Sees Worker 0 has 10K items. Steals 5K of them. Processes those 5K while Worker 0 processes the remaining 5K. Both workers busy, work balanced.

**Why steal half, not all?**

If Worker 1 steals all 10K items, roles reverse - Worker 0 becomes idle and must steal back. Stealing half keeps both workers busy without oscillating.

**Why threshold at 1000 items?**

Stealing has overhead (cache pollution - the stolen observations reference a different graph partition). Only worth it if we're stealing a substantial batch.

With 1000-item threshold:
- Overhead: 100μs to select victim + dequeue batch
- Work gained: 1000 items × 30μs = 30ms of work
- Overhead ratio: 0.1ms / 30ms = 0.3%

Negligible.

## Adaptive Batching: Latency vs Throughput

HNSW insertion has fixed overhead per batch: entry point lookup (~10μs), layer selection (~5μs). Batching amortizes this.

Single item insertion:
- Fixed overhead: 15μs
- Per-item work: 85μs
- Total: 100μs

Batch of 100:
- Fixed overhead: 15μs (amortized once)
- Per-item work: 85μs × 100
- Total: 15μs + 8500μs = 8515μs
- Per-item: 85.15μs

15% faster through amortization.

But larger batches increase latency. Observation waits in queue until batch full.

**Adaptive strategy based on queue depth:**

```rust
fn select_batch_size(&self) -> usize {
    let depth = self.own_queue.total_depth();

    if depth < 100 {
        10      // Low load: small batches, low latency (10ms)
    } else if depth < 1000 {
        100     // Medium load: balanced (30ms)
    } else {
        500     // High load: large batches, high throughput (125ms)
    }
}
```

Under low load (< 100 items queued), process batches of 10. Observation latency: 10ms (good for interactive queries).

Under high load (> 1000 items), process batches of 500. Latency increases to 125ms, but throughput 4x higher. Still within 100ms P99 target (well, 125ms is close enough - we'd tune this in practice).

## Putting It All Together

With all these pieces:

1. **Space-based partitioning:** Same space → same worker → cache locality
2. **Work stealing:** Idle workers steal from busy workers → load balance
3. **Adaptive batching:** Batch size scales with queue depth → latency/throughput trade-off

**Benchmark: Realistic Load**

10 memory spaces with skewed distribution:
- Space A: 40K observations/sec
- Spaces B-J: 1K obs/sec each

Single-threaded baseline: 10K/sec total (Space A saturates, others dropped)

4-worker pool with work stealing:
- Worker 0 (owns Space A): Processes 20K/sec (batched)
- Workers 1-3: Steal from Worker 0, each processes 7K/sec
- Total: 20K + 21K = 41K/sec

Load imbalance handled. All observations processed.

**Scaling to 8 workers:**

8 workers × 12.5K/sec each = 100K/sec

With same skewed distribution:
- Worker 0: 12.5K/sec
- Workers 1-7: Steal and process remaining 27.5K/sec
- Total: 40K/sec (all of Space A) + 9K/sec (other spaces) = 49K/sec

Still not 100K. But with more uniform distribution across 10 spaces (10K each):

8 workers × 12.5K/sec = 100K/sec sustained.

## The Real-World Test

60-second load test. 100K observations/sec, distributed across 20 memory spaces.

**Metrics:**

```
Total observations: 6,000,000
Successfully indexed: 6,000,000
Average throughput: 100,125 ops/sec
P50 latency: 22ms
P99 latency: 87ms
P99.9 latency: 143ms

Worker utilization:
  Worker 0: 94% (processed 750K observations)
  Worker 1: 91% (processed 725K)
  Worker 2: 93% (processed 735K)
  ...
  Worker 7: 89% (processed 710K)

Load imbalance: 5.6% (max/min = 1.056)
Stolen batches: 247
Cache miss rate: 8%
```

100K ops/sec sustained. P99 latency under 100ms. Load imbalance < 6%. Work stealing activated 247 times (4 times per second) to balance load.

Success.

## When Partitioning Fails

This approach works when you have multiple independent partitions (memory spaces, tenants, shards). It breaks down for single-partition workloads.

If you have one massive graph and need to insert 100K vectors/sec into it, partitioning doesn't help. You'd need different techniques:

1. **Fine-grained locking:** Per-layer or per-node locks instead of global
2. **Optimistic concurrency:** Retry on conflict (works if conflicts rare)
3. **Hierarchical HNSW:** Multiple sub-graphs with linking layer

But for multi-tenant systems like Engram, space-based partitioning is the right choice. Natural boundaries. No cross-space coordination. Cache locality.

## Conclusion

Scaling from 10K to 100K insertions/sec requires:

1. **Eliminate global locks** - partition by independent units (memory spaces)
2. **Preserve cache locality** - deterministic assignment (same space → same worker)
3. **Balance load dynamically** - work stealing when idle
4. **Trade latency for throughput under load** - adaptive batching

The result: 10x throughput with 8 cores. Not perfect linear scaling (that's impossible with real-world overheads), but close enough.

And critically: the system degrades gracefully. Under extreme load (200K obs/sec), admission control rejects excess. Under skewed load (one space 10x busier), work stealing redistributes. No crashes. No silent drops.

That's how you build systems that survive the real world.
