# Parallel HNSW Workers: Multiple Perspectives

## Systems Architecture Perspective

Space-based sharding solves the classic distributed systems problem: how do you partition work without creating coordination overhead?

Traditional approaches (range partitioning, consistent hashing, directory-based) all require coordination. Engram's approach: deterministic hash-based assignment with work stealing for load balance.

Key insight: coordination overhead is acceptable during work stealing (rare) but unacceptable on every operation (common). Design for the common case.

## Rust Graph Engine Perspective

Lock-free composition: queue (SegQueue) + index (concurrent HNSW) + workers (no shared state) = end-to-end lock-free pipeline.

Critical property: operations touch different memory locations. Producer writes to tail, consumer reads from head, worker modifies graph node. No false sharing.

False sharing would kill performance: two variables on same 64-byte cache line cause cache ping-pong even if logically independent.

## Memory Systems Perspective

Parallel memory consolidation mirrors parallel hippocampal indexing. Different experiences (memory spaces) consolidate independently. When one experience dominates (high-traffic space), attention redistributes (work stealing).

The brain doesn't have a global scheduler. Neither should Engram. Decentralized work stealing > centralized load balancing.

## Cognitive Architecture Perspective

Cache locality = working memory. When you process related information (same memory space), it stays "active" in working memory (CPU cache). Context switches (switching spaces) flush working memory, requiring reload from long-term memory (RAM).

Minimize context switches by deterministic assignment. Accept occasional context switches (work stealing) for load balance.

## Distributed Systems Perspective

Comparison to MapReduce, Spark, Flink: All use similar partitioning strategies (hash-based sharding). Engram's novelty: work stealing for graph databases, not just stateless computation.

Graph databases (Neo4j, TigerGraph) typically use static partitioning with no work stealing. Engram adds dynamic load balancing while preserving cache locality.
