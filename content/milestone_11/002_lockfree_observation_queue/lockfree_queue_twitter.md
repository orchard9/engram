# Lock-Free Queue: Twitter Thread

## Tweet 1/8

Your streaming system needs to queue 100K items/sec.

You reach for Mutex<VecDeque>. It's safe, it's simple, it works.

Then you measure: 52K ops/sec with 8 cores.

Wait, what? You're barely faster than single-threaded.

The bottleneck: cache coherence protocol overhead. Thread on lock-free queues:

## Tweet 2/8

When 8 threads fight for the same mutex, they're really fighting for the same cache line.

Core 0 acquires → invalidates other cores' caches
Core 1 tries → cache miss, must fetch from Core 0
Core 2 tries → cache miss...

You spend more time shuffling cache lines than doing work.

Lock-free solution: crossbeam::queue::SegQueue

```rust
let queue = Arc::new(SegQueue::new());

// Producer (no mutex!)
queue.push(item);

// Consumer (no mutex!)
queue.pop()
```

Benchmark: 4.8M ops/sec

That's 92x faster than Mutex<VecDeque>.

## Tweet 4/8

How does it work?

Separate head and tail pointers:

```rust
struct SegQueue {
    head: AtomicPtr,  // Consumers pop here
    tail: AtomicPtr,  // Producers push here
}
```

Producers only touch tail.
Consumers only touch head.
Different cache lines = no contention.

But wait, isn't SegQueue unbounded? Won't it grow forever?

Yes, but we add admission control:

```rust
if depth >= capacity {
    return Err(QueueError::OverCapacity);
}
queue.push(item);
```

Soft limit. Reject when full, don't block.

Client gets error, knows to retry or slow down.

## Tweet 6/8

For priority lanes, use multiple queues:

```rust
struct ObservationQueue {
    high: SegQueue,
    normal: SegQueue,
    low: SegQueue,
}

fn dequeue() -> Option<Item> {
    high.pop()
        .or_else(|| normal.pop())
        .or_else(|| low.pop())
}
```

No global coordination.
High priority always first.

Real-world test: 8 producer threads, 4 consumer threads, 100K items/sec

Mutex<VecDeque>:
- Throughput: 52K/sec
- Queue grows to 500K items
- OOM after 60 seconds

SegQueue:
- Throughput: 100K/sec (sustained)
- Queue stable at 50K items
- 10 minutes, no issues

## Tweet 8/8

When to use lock-free?

Use Mutex when:
- Low contention (1-2 threads)
- Complex operations
- Simplicity matters

Use lock-free when:
- High contention (8+ threads)
- Simple operations (push/pop)
- Need 100K+ ops/sec

Measure, don't guess.

## Bonus: Performance Deep Dive Thread

**Thread on Cache Coherence:**

The MESI protocol (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) ensures cache consistency.

When you write to a cache line, all other cores' copies become Invalid.

Next read from another core: cache miss, must fetch from L3 or other core's L1.

This is why mutex contention kills performance.

**Thread on Lock-Free Progress Guarantees:**

Lock-free ≠ wait-free

Lock-free: At least one thread makes progress (no deadlock, possible starvation)
Wait-free: Every thread makes progress (no deadlock, no starvation)

SegQueue is lock-free. Under heavy contention, one thread might retry CAS many times while others succeed.

But for queues, lock-free is sufficient. Wait-free is overkill.

**Thread on Memory Ordering:**

Why Ordering::Relaxed for depth counters?

```rust
self.depth.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
```

We don't need synchronization between depth and queue operations. They're independent.

Backpressure detection can tolerate slightly stale depth values (lag by a few items).

Relaxed is fastest - no memory barriers.

**Thread on Segment Allocation:**

SegQueue allocates new segments when current is full (32 items).

Allocation cost: ~500ns
Frequency: Every 32 pushes
Amortized: 500ns / 32 = 15.6ns per push

Compare to:
- Push overhead: 180ns
- Allocation overhead: 15.6ns (8.6% of total)

Negligible. The linked segments are worth it for unbounded growth.

## ASCII Diagrams

```
Mutex Contention:

Thread 0: [LOCK] → owns cache line
Thread 1: [WAIT] → cache miss, spinning
Thread 2: [WAIT] → cache miss, spinning
Thread 3: [WAIT] → cache miss, spinning

One thread works, others wait.
Throughput: 52K ops/sec
```

```
Lock-Free Concurrent Access:

Thread 0: [PUSH] → tail pointer (cache line A)
Thread 1: [PUSH] → tail pointer (cache line A)
Thread 2: [POP]  → head pointer (cache line B)
Thread 3: [POP]  → head pointer (cache line B)

All threads work simultaneously.
Throughput: 4.8M ops/sec
```

```
Priority Lanes:

High Priority Queue    → Worker dequeues high first
   [H1] [H2] [H3]

Normal Priority Queue  → Then normal
   [N1] [N2] [N3] [N4] [N5]

Low Priority Queue     → Finally low
   [L1] [L2]

No global coordination, just ordered check.
```

## Engagement Hooks

What makes this thread compelling?

1. **Concrete numbers:** "92x faster" - everyone loves benchmarks
2. **Surprising result:** "8 cores, 52K ops/sec" - why so slow?
3. **Practical code:** Show actual Rust code, not pseudocode
4. **Real-world scenario:** Streaming 100K items/sec is realistic
5. **Trade-offs:** When NOT to use lock-free (balanced perspective)

## Call to Action

"Building high-throughput systems in Rust? Don't assume Mutex is fast enough.

Benchmark with realistic workloads (8+ threads, high contention). You might be surprised.

Try crossbeam::queue for lock-free alternatives.
