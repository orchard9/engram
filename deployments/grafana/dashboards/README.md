## Metric Mappings

All dashboards use metrics exported by Engram's Prometheus exporter at `/metrics/prometheus`. Key metric categories:

### Spreading Activation
- `engram_spreading_activations_total` - Counter of total activations
- `engram_spreading_latency_hot_seconds` - Hot tier latency summary
- `engram_spreading_latency_warm_seconds` - Warm tier latency summary
- `engram_spreading_latency_cold_seconds` - Cold tier latency summary
- `engram_spreading_latency_budget_violations_total` - SLO violations
- `engram_spreading_failures_total` - Failed operations
- `engram_spreading_breaker_state` - Circuit breaker (0=closed, 1=open, 2=half-open)

### Consolidation
- `engram_consolidation_runs_total` - Successful consolidation runs
- `engram_consolidation_failures_total` - Failed consolidations
- `engram_consolidation_novelty_gauge` - Novelty delta
- `engram_consolidation_novelty_variance` - Pattern variance
- `engram_consolidation_citation_churn` - Citation change rate
- `engram_consolidation_freshness_seconds` - Snapshot age
- `engram_consolidation_citations_current` - Total citations

### Storage & Compaction
- `engram_compaction_attempts_total` - Compaction initiations
- `engram_compaction_success_total` - Successful compactions
- `engram_compaction_episodes_removed` - Episodes removed
- `engram_compaction_storage_saved_bytes` - Bytes reclaimed
- `engram_wal_recovery_duration_seconds` - WAL recovery latency
- `engram_wal_compaction_bytes_reclaimed` - WAL space reclaimed

### Activation Pool
- `activation_pool_available_records` - Available slots
- `activation_pool_in_flight_records` - Active operations
- `activation_pool_high_water_mark` - Peak usage
- `activation_pool_hit_rate` - Cache efficiency

### Adaptive Batching
- `adaptive_batch_hot_size` / `warm_size` / `cold_size` - Batch sizes per tier
- `adaptive_batch_hot_confidence` / `warm_confidence` / `cold_confidence` - Convergence confidence
- `adaptive_guardrail_hits_total` - Guardrail activations
- `adaptive_topology_changes_total` - Tier promotion/demotion

## Installation

### Docker Compose
Dashboards are automatically provisioned when using the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker-compose --profile monitoring up
```

Grafana will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (default credentials: admin/admin).

### Manual Import
1. Open Grafana UI
2. Navigate to Dashboards > Import
3. Upload JSON file or paste JSON content
4. Select Prometheus datasource
5. Click Import

## Dashboard Features

### Template Variables
All dashboards include a `datasource` template variable for selecting the Prometheus data source. Future enhancements will add:
- `memory_space` - Filter by memory space/tenant
- `instance` - Filter by Engram instance
- `tier` - Filter by storage tier (hot/warm/cold)

### Refresh Intervals
- Default: 10 seconds auto-refresh
- Available: 5s, 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h

### Time Ranges
- Default: Last 1 hour
- Customizable via time picker

### Alert Annotations
All dashboards support Grafana alert annotations, which will appear as vertical lines on graphs when alerts fire.

## Customization

### Adding Panels
Each dashboard follows Grafana's standard panel structure:
- Panel IDs must be unique within a dashboard
- Grid positions use a 24-column layout
- Heights are in grid units (1 unit = ~30px)

### Modifying Queries
All PromQL queries use 5-minute rate windows (`[5m]`) aligned with the Prometheus scrape interval. Adjust based on your scrape configuration.

### Threshold Tuning
Color thresholds are based on production SLOs:
- Latency: Green < 50ms, Yellow < 100ms, Red >= 100ms
- Error Rate: Green < 1%, Yellow < 5%, Red >= 5%
- Utilization: Green < 70%, Yellow < 90%, Red >= 90%

Adjust these in the field config for each panel based on your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing
1. Verify Prometheus is scraping Engram: Check `up{job="engram"}` metric
2. Confirm metrics endpoint is accessible: `curl http://engram:7432/metrics/prometheus`
3. Check Prometheus targets: `http://prometheus:9090/targets`
4. Verify time range covers available data

### Missing Metrics
Some panels may show "No data" if certain features are not yet instrumented:
- API-specific metrics (REST/gRPC endpoint labels)
- Per-tenant metrics (memory_space labels)
- Storage tier capacity metrics (if not configured)

These will be added as the instrumentation evolves.

### Performance Issues
If dashboards are slow:
1. Increase Prometheus retention and query timeout
2. Use recording rules for expensive queries (see `recording_rules.yml`)
3. Reduce auto-refresh interval
4. Narrow time range

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Metrics
- Per-endpoint API metrics with method/path labels
- Per-tenant resource usage (memory_space label)
- GPU memory utilization and kernel launch latencies
- Network I/O by tier
- Query complexity distributions

### Planned Dashboards
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA kernel performance, memory transfers, fallback analysis
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Per-tenant resource usage, isolation metrics, quota enforcement
- **Cognitive Dynamics**: Memory decay curves, pattern completion success rates, system 2 reasoning

### Advanced Features
- Anomaly detection using Grafana ML
- Predictive capacity alerts
- Custom SLO tracking with error budgets
- Distributed tracing integration (Tempo)
- Log correlation (Loki)

## Validation

All JSON files have been validated:
- Valid JSON syntax
- Unique panel IDs within each dashboard
- Proper Grafana schema version (38)
- Prometheus datasource compatibility
