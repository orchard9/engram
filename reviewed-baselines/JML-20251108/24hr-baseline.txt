Start Time: Sat Nov  8 01:28:28 AM UTC 2025
Expected End Time: Sun Nov  9 01:28:28 AM UTC 2025

Initial Status (at 1 hour 23 minutes runtime):
- PID: 3112549
- CPU Usage: 21.5%
- Memory Usage: 27.8%
- RSS: 9077684 KB (~8.7 GB)
- VSZ: 139171572 KB (~132.7 GB)
- Elapsed Time: 01:22:55
- Health: healthy

Configuration:
- HTTP Port: 7433
- gRPC Port: 50052
- Memory Spaces: default, psychology, figurative, and others

Monitoring Plan:
- Process will run continuously for 24 hours
- Periodic health checks via http://localhost:7433/health
- Monitor for memory leaks (RSS growth)
- Monitor for CPU usage patterns
- Check for log errors/warnings

Success Criteria:
- Service remains healthy for 24 hours
- No memory leaks (RSS stable)
- No crashes or restarts
- CPU usage remains reasonable (<50% average)
- All APIs remain responsive

Notes:
- High VSZ is normal for memory-mapped operations
- Current memory usage is stable after 1+ hour
- CPU usage consistent around 20-22%
