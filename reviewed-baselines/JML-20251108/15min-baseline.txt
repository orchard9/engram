Start Time: Sat Nov  8 12:51:36 AM UTC 2025
End Time: Sat Nov  8 01:09:07 AM UTC 2025
Duration: 17.5 minutes (15 min test + 2.5 min buffer)
Total Runtime: ~50 minutes since start

Process Stats:
- PID: 3112549
- CPU Usage: 22.8% (increased from 20.8%)
- Memory Usage: 27.8% (stable)
- RSS: 9077684 KB (~8.7 GB, minimal increase)
- VSZ: 139171572 KB (~132.7 GB, unchanged)

Health Check: PASSED
- Service: engram
- Status: healthy
- Version: 0.1.0

Metrics Observations:
- Activation pool utilization: 0.0 (pool underutilized)
- Spreading latency: ~26-27 microseconds (excellent)
- Spreading activation pool hit rate: 100%
- Memory consolidation: Active (consolidation logs observed)
- No ERROR logs observed
- Few WARN logs (ports occupied, using alternatives)

Performance Summary:
- CPU usage slightly increased but stable (~22%)
- Memory usage very stable (8.7 GB RSS)
- Service remained healthy throughout test
- All metrics within expected ranges
- No performance degradation observed

Notes:
- High virtual memory (VSZ) is typical for memory-mapped files
- Actual memory usage (RSS) is reasonable at 8.7 GB
- System performing spreading activation probes regularly
- Metrics streaming working correctly
