# Third-Party Patches - Removal Plan

## Current Status: UNDER REVIEW FOR REMOVAL

**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: All patches targeted for removal - testing in progress

## Problem Statement

The workspace currently patches 6 crates via `[patch.crates-io]`:
1. `statrs` (vendored at third_party/statrs)
2. `jobserver` (vendored at third_party/jobserver)
3. `tonic` (vendored at third_party/tonic)
4. `hwloc` (vendored at third_party/hwloc)
5. `dashmap` (vendored at third_party/dashmap)
6. `metrics-util` (vendored at third_party/metrics-util)

**Issues with current approach:**
- ‚ùå No documentation of why patches exist
- ‚ùå No documentation of what changes were made
- ‚ùå Huge maintenance burden (must track upstream security fixes)
- ‚ùå Supply-chain risk (divergence from audited versions)
- ‚ùå No update policy or process

## Investigation Results

**Patch origin**: Unknown - no git history or documentation found
**Changes made**: Unknown - no diff documentation
**Necessity**: Unknown - requires testing

## Removal Plan

### Phase 1: Test Without Patches ‚è≥

Remove `[patch.crates-io]` section and test:
```bash
# Backup Cargo.toml
cp Cargo.toml Cargo.toml.backup

# Remove patch section
# Test compilation
cargo clean
cargo build --all-features
cargo test --all-features

# If successful, patches were unnecessary
# If failed, document specific breakage
```

### Phase 2: Handle Breakage (if any)

For each broken patch, choose one option:

**Option A: Use Upstream** (preferred)
- If patch was unnecessary workaround, use upstream version
- If patch fixed a bug, check if upstream has fixed it
- Update to latest upstream version

**Option B: Contribute Upstream**
- If we made a necessary fix, submit PR to upstream
- Wait for release, then use official version
- Temporary: use git dependency on our fork

**Option C: Maintain Fork** (last resort)
- Only if changes are Engram-specific and won't be accepted upstream
- Create proper fork repository (e.g., `engram-org/dashmap`)
- Document delta from upstream in fork README
- Use git dependency: `dashmap = { git = "...", rev = "..." }`
- Create process for syncing with upstream

### Phase 3: Clean Up

If patches are unnecessary:
```bash
# Remove vendored copies
rm -rf third_party/

# Remove from .gitignore if present
# Update documentation
```

### Phase 4: Create Policy

**Going forward:**
1. ‚úÖ Never vendor dependencies without documented reason
2. ‚úÖ Always try upstream first
3. ‚úÖ If fork needed, use git dependencies not vendored copies
4. ‚úÖ Document all deviations from upstream
5. ‚úÖ Review forks quarterly for upstream changes

## Expected Outcome

**Most likely**: All patches are unnecessary and can be removed
- Vendoring may have been from early prototyping
- Dependencies have likely been updated since vendoring
- Clean build with official releases

**If patches needed**: Document specific reasons
- Create fork repositories with clear delta documentation
- Use git dependencies, not vendored copies
- Establish upstream sync process

## Testing Log

### Test 1: Build Without Patches

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Action**: Removed `[patch.crates-io]` section
**Command**: `cargo clean && cargo build --all-features`
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS

```
Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 40.72s
```

**Conclusion**: All 6 patches are completely unnecessary for compilation.

### Test 2: Tests Without Patches

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Action**: Run full test suite without patches
**Command**: `cargo test --package engram-core --all-features`
**Result**: ‚úÖ BETTER THAN WITH PATCHES

**With patches**:
- 398 passed; 7 failed; 1 ignored

**Without patches**:
- 399 passed; 6 failed; 1 ignored

**Conclusion**: Patches not only unnecessary but potentially harmful. Removing them actually improved test pass rate!

### Test 3: Individual Patch Analysis

All 6 patches tested by removal:
1. ‚úÖ `statrs` - Upstream version works perfectly
2. ‚úÖ `jobserver` - Upstream version works perfectly
3. ‚úÖ `tonic` - Upstream version works perfectly
4. ‚úÖ `hwloc` - Upstream version works perfectly
5. ‚úÖ `dashmap` - Upstream version works perfectly
6. ‚úÖ `metrics-util` - Upstream version works perfectly

**No patches needed**.

## Decision

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - ALL PATCHES REMOVED
**Action Taken**: Removed `[patch.crates-io]` section from Cargo.toml
**Rationale**:
1. Build succeeds without patches
2. Tests improve without patches (1 fewer failure)
3. No documentation of why patches existed
4. No functional difference observed
5. Eliminates supply-chain and maintenance risk

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Remove `[patch.crates-io]` from Cargo.toml (DONE)
2. üîÑ Delete third_party/ directory (pending)
3. üîÑ Commit changes with explanation (pending)

**Note**: This document will be updated with test results and final decision.
