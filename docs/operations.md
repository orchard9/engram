# Engram Operational Guide

*Production-ready procedures designed for cognitive ergonomics under stress*

## üö® Emergency Procedures (Cognitive Load: LOW)

### System Unresponsive
**SYMPTOMS**: Server not responding to health checks, connection refused
**IMMEDIATE ACTION** (2 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Check if process exists
engram status

# 2. If running but unresponsive, force restart
engram stop --force
engram start

# 3. Verify recovery
engram status
curl http://localhost:7432/health/alive
```

### Memory Leak Detected  
**SYMPTOMS**: RAM usage >90%, system slowdown
**IMMEDIATE ACTION** (3 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Check memory usage
ps aux | grep engram
top -p $(pgrep engram)

# 2. Restart service to clear memory
engram stop
engram start

# 3. Monitor for recurrence
watch -n 10 'ps aux | grep engram'
```

### Port Conflict
**SYMPTOMS**: "Address already in use" error on startup  
**IMMEDIATE ACTION** (1 minute):
```bash
# 1. Check what's using the port
lsof -i :7432

# 2. Start on different port
engram start --port 7433

# 3. Update client connections to new port
```

## üìã Common Operations (Cognitive Load: LOW-MEDIUM)

<details>
<summary>Start/Stop/Restart Procedures</summary>

### Starting Engram Server

**CONTEXT**: When to start the server
- System is fully stopped (verify with `engram status`)
- Sufficient resources available (minimum 2GB RAM, 1GB disk)
- No port conflicts on default ports 7432/50051

**ACTION**: Step-by-step startup
```bash
# 1. Verify system is stopped
engram status
# Expected output: "No server running"

# 2. Start server with monitoring
engram start --port 7432 --grpc-port 50051
# Expected: Server starts, shows HTTP and gRPC endpoints

# 3. Wait for initialization (typical: 5-15 seconds)
# - Server binding: Address shows in output
# - Process startup: PID file created
# - API availability: Health endpoint responsive
```

**VERIFICATION**: Confirming successful start
```bash
# 1. Status check passes
engram status
# Expected: "Server online" with PID and port info

# 2. Health endpoint responds
curl http://localhost:7432/api/v1/system/health
# Expected: HTTP 200 with JSON health status

# 3. API endpoints accessible  
curl http://localhost:7432/api/v1/system/introspect
# Expected: System introspection information

# 4. gRPC service available (when implemented)
# grpcurl localhost:50051 list
```

**TROUBLESHOOTING**: If verification fails
- If status shows offline: Check logs for startup errors
- If health check fails: Port may be occupied, try different port
- If connection refused: Firewall or network configuration issue

### Stopping Engram Server

**CONTEXT**: When to stop the server
- Maintenance window scheduled
- System upgrade required
- Resource cleanup needed

**ACTION**: Graceful shutdown
```bash
# 1. Initiate graceful shutdown
engram stop
# Expected: Server begins shutdown process

# 2. Wait for completion (typical: 5-10 seconds)
# - Existing connections complete
# - Resources cleaned up
# - PID file removed
```

**VERIFICATION**: Confirming successful stop
```bash
# 1. Status check shows offline
engram status
# Expected: "No server running"

# 2. Process no longer exists
ps aux | grep engram
# Expected: No engram processes listed

# 3. Port is released
lsof -i :7432
# Expected: No processes using port
```

**FORCE SHUTDOWN**: If graceful stop fails
```bash
# Only use if graceful shutdown hangs >30 seconds
engram stop --force

# Verify forced shutdown worked
engram status
```

### Server Health Monitoring

**CONTEXT**: Ongoing health assessment
- Regular health checks every 5-10 minutes
- Before making configuration changes
- After any system modifications

**ACTION**: Health check procedure
```bash
# 1. Basic status check
engram status

# 2. Detailed health with JSON output
engram status --json
# Shows: detailed status, health endpoints, response times

# 3. Continuous monitoring
engram status --watch
# Updates every 5 seconds (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

**VERIFICATION**: Healthy system indicators
- Status: "online"

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Continuous Health Monitoring

**Setup monitoring for production deployment**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor-engram.sh - Continuous monitoring script

while true; do
    # Check server status
    if ! engram status --json | jq -r '.status' | grep -q "online"; then
        echo "ALERT: Engram server offline at $(date)"
        # Add alerting mechanism here (email, Slack, etc.)
    fi
    
    # Check health endpoint response time
    start_time=$(date +%s%N)
    curl -s http://localhost:7432/api/v1/system/health >/dev/null 2>&1
    end_time=$(date +%s%N)
    response_time=$(( (end_time - start_time) / 1000000 )) # Convert to ms
    
    if [ $response_time -gt 1000 ]; then
        echo "ALERT: Slow response time ${response_time}ms at $(date)"
    fi
    
    # Check memory usage
    memory_percent=$(ps aux | grep engram | awk '{print $4}' | head -1)
    if [ "$(echo "$memory_percent > 80" | bc -l)" == "1" ]; then
        echo "ALERT: High memory usage ${memory_percent}% at $(date)"
    fi
    
    sleep 300 # Check every 5 minutes
done
```

### Production Metrics

**Key metrics to monitor**:
- **Server Status**: online/offline state  
- **Response Time**: API endpoint response latency
- **Memory Usage**: Process memory consumption
- **Error Rate**: Failed operations percentage
- **Memory Count**: Number of stored memories

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Response time >1000ms
- Memory usage >80%  
- Server offline >30 seconds
- Error rate >5%
