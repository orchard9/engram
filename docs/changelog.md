# Documentation Changelog

## Unreleased

- Marked the spreading activation API as **beta**. The CLI now manages a `spreading_api_beta` feature flag stored in `~/.config/engram/config.toml` with defaults from `engram-cli/config/default.toml`.
- Added Di√°taxis-aligned documentation for spreading activation (tutorial, how-to guides, explanation, and reference), along with deterministic visualization tooling.
