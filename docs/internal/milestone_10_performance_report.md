## Known Limitations and Considerations

### Zig Installation Requirement

**Current Blocker**:
- Zig 0.13.0 not installed in current environment
- All runtime tests pending installation
- Build system validated, execution pending

**Installation Path**:
```bash
# macOS
brew install zig

# Linux
wget https://ziglang.org/download/0.13.0/zig-linux-x86_64-0.13.0.tar.xz
tar xf zig-linux-x86_64-0.13.0.tar.xz
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/zig-linux-x86_64-0.13.0
```

### Clippy Warnings in Test Code

**Status**:
- Production code: Clean (zero warnings)
- Test code: 100+ clippy warnings across test files
- Examples: 34 clippy warnings in query_examples.rs

**Impact**: Low - Test code quality warnings do not affect production runtime

**Remediation Plan**:
- Schedule post-milestone cleanup task
- Add comprehensive #![allow(...)] attributes to test modules
- Prioritize production code quality over test code style

**Specific Files with Warnings**:
- `engram-core/tests/query_integration_test.rs`: Format/style warnings
- `engram-core/tests/error_message_validation.rs`: Format warnings
- `engram-core/tests/zig_kernels_integration.rs`: Loop/collection warnings
- `engram-core/tests/query_language_corpus.rs`: const fn warnings
- `engram-core/benches/query_parser.rs`: Format/documentation warnings

### Performance Regression Detection

**Regression Threshold**: 5% performance degradation triggers CI failure

**Monitoring Approach**:
- Baseline measurements captured per kernel
- Automated benchmarking on every commit
- Historical tracking for trend analysis

**False Positive Mitigation**:
- Multiple runs (min 10 iterations)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Platform-specific baselines
