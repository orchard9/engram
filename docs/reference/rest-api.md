## Getting Started

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`

All REST endpoints use JSON for request and response bodies. The API follows RESTful conventions with cognitive-friendly method names that reflect how memory actually works.

### Why REST for Memory Operations?

While gRPC offers better performance for high-throughput scenarios, REST provides:

- Browser compatibility for web frontends

- Human-readable debugging with curl

- Simple integration for occasional API calls

- Familiar HTTP semantics

For high-throughput operations (>100/sec) or streaming consolidation, use the [gRPC API](/reference/grpc-api.md) instead.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ENGRAM_API_KEY}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/recall

```

### Obtaining an API Key

```bash
# Generate new API key
engram auth create-key --name "my-application"

# Output
API Key: ek_live_1234567890abcdef
Memory Space: default
Permissions: read,write,consolidate

```

For multi-tenant deployments, each API key is scoped to a specific memory space. See [Multi-Tenant Isolation](#multi-tenant-isolation) for details.

## Core Memory Operations

### POST /api/v1/memories/remember

Store a new memory with confidence scoring.

Think of this as "teaching" Engram something new. Unlike database INSERT operations that assume perfect accuracy, `remember` acknowledges that memories have varying levels of certainty.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/remember \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "memory": {
      "content": "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991",
      "embedding": [0.12, -0.45, 0.78, ...],
      "confidence": {
        "value": 0.95,
        "reasoning": "Verified from authoritative source"
      }
    },
    "auto_link": true,
    "link_threshold": 0.7
  }'

```

#### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `memory_space_id` | string | No | Memory space for multi-tenant isolation. Defaults to authenticated user's space. |
| `memory.content` | string | No | Human-readable memory content |
| `memory.embedding` | float[] | Yes | 768-dimensional semantic embedding vector |
| `memory.confidence.value` | float | Yes | Confidence score [0.0, 1.0] |
| `memory.confidence.reasoning` | string | No | Why this confidence level |
| `auto_link` | boolean | No | Automatically link to related memories (default: true) |
| `link_threshold` | float | No | Similarity threshold for auto-linking (default: 0.7) |

#### Response (201 Created)

```json
{
  "memory_id": "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
  "storage_confidence": {
    "value": 0.98,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_CERTAIN",
    "reasoning": "Successfully stored in hot tier with 3 auto-linked memories"
  },
  "linked_memories": [
    "mem_1698765001_x1y2z3",
    "mem_1698764890_p4q5r6",
    "mem_1698764123_m7n8o9"
  ],
  "initial_state": "CONSOLIDATION_STATE_RECENT"
}

```

#### What Just Happened?

Engram stored your memory and automatically found three related memories based on semantic similarity. These connections enable spreading activation during recall - when you retrieve one memory, related memories become more accessible, just like how your brain works.

The memory starts in "recent" state and will be consolidated during the next dream cycle, potentially forming stronger connections or merging with similar memories.

#### Neo4j Equivalent

```cypher
// Traditional graph database approach
CREATE (m:Memory {
  content: "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991",
  embedding: [0.12, -0.45, 0.78, ...],
  created_at: timestamp()
})
RETURN m

// Must manually create relationships
MATCH (m1:Memory), (m2:Memory)
WHERE id(m1) = $new_id
  AND vectorSimilarity(m1.embedding, m2.embedding) > 0.7
CREATE (m1)-[:RELATED_TO]->(m2)

```

Engram handles relationship creation automatically and includes confidence scoring on both storage and linking operations.

#### Performance

- P50 latency: 12ms

- P99 latency: 45ms

- Throughput: ~80 requests/sec (single instance)

For batch operations, use gRPC streaming to achieve 4.9x better performance.

### POST /api/v1/memories/recall

Retrieve memories using various cue types with spreading activation.

This is where Engram differs most from traditional databases. Instead of exact matching or simple similarity search, recall uses cognitive retrieval patterns with confidence-weighted results.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/recall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "cue": {
      "semantic": {
        "query": "programming language history",
        "fuzzy_threshold": 0.6
      }
    },
    "max_results": 10,
    "include_metadata": true,
    "trace_activation": true
  }'

```

#### Cue Types

Engram supports multiple retrieval cue types, each modeling different cognitive access patterns:

##### Embedding Cue (Direct Similarity)

```json
{
  "cue": {
    "embedding": {
      "vector": [0.15, -0.42, 0.81, ...],
      "similarity_threshold": 0.75
    }
  }
}

```

Like trying to remember something from a visual or sensory trigger.

##### Semantic Cue (Natural Language)

```json
{
  "cue": {
    "semantic": {
      "query": "Python programming",
      "fuzzy_threshold": 0.6,
      "required_tags": ["programming"],
      "excluded_tags": ["deprecated"]
    }
  }
}

```

Like remembering from a verbal description or concept.

##### Context Cue (Episodic)

```json
{
  "cue": {
    "context": {
      "time_start": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "time_end": "2024-01-31T23:59:59Z",
      "location": "office",
      "participants": ["Alice", "Bob"]
    }
  }
}

```

Like remembering "what happened last January at the office?"

##### Pattern Cue (Partial Memory)

```json
{
  "cue": {
    "pattern": {
      "fragments": [
        {
          "known_fields": {
            "content": "Python was created by"
          },
          "missing_fields": ["date", "location"],
          "fragment_confidence": {
            "value": 0.8
          }
        }
      ],
      "completion_threshold": 0.5
    }
  }
}

```

Like tip-of-the-tongue experiences where you know part of a memory.

#### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `memory_space_id` | string | No | Memory space identifier |
| `cue` | object | Yes | Retrieval cue (see cue types above) |
| `max_results` | int32 | No | Maximum memories to return (default: 10) |
| `include_metadata` | boolean | No | Include recall statistics (default: false) |
| `trace_activation` | boolean | No | Include spreading activation trace (default: false) |

#### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
      "content": "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991",
      "embedding": [0.12, -0.45, 0.78, ...],
      "activation": 0.92,
      "confidence": {
        "value": 0.95,
        "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_CERTAIN",
        "reasoning": "Direct semantic match"
      },
      "last_access": "2024-10-27T10:30:00Z",
      "created_at": "2024-10-15T08:00:00Z",
      "decay_rate": 0.05
    }
  ],
  "recall_confidence": {
    "value": 0.89,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_HIGH",
    "reasoning": "Strong cue-to-memory match with spreading activation"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "total_activated": 45,
    "above_threshold": 10,
    "avg_activation": 0.67,
    "recall_time_ms": 23,
    "activation_path": [
      "mem_seed_query",
      "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
      "mem_1698765001_x1y2z3"
    ]
  },
  "traces": [
    {
      "memory_id": "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
      "activation_level": 0.92,
      "activation_path": ["query", "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4"],
      "timestamp": "2024-10-27T10:30:00.123Z"
    }
  ]
}

```

#### Understanding Confidence vs Activation

- **Confidence**: How certain we are that this memory is accurate (intrinsic property)

- **Activation**: How accessible this memory is right now (dynamic, context-dependent)

A memory can have high confidence (95% sure it's true) but low activation (0.3 - hard to access). Conversely, a recent but uncertain memory might have low confidence (0.6) but high activation (0.95).

#### Performance

- P50 latency: 35ms

- P99 latency: 120ms

- Throughput: ~45 requests/sec

Spreading activation adds 10-50ms depending on graph connectivity.

### POST /api/v1/memories/forget

Remove or suppress memories with configurable forgetting modes.

Unlike database DELETE operations, forgetting in Engram can be reversible or gradual, modeling how biological forgetting actually works.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/forget \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "memory_id": "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
    "mode": "FORGET_MODE_SUPPRESS"
  }'

```

#### Forget Modes

| Mode | Reversible | Effect | Use Case |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| `FORGET_MODE_SUPPRESS` | Yes | Reduce activation, increase decay | Temporarily downrank memories |
| `FORGET_MODE_DELETE` | No | Permanent removal | GDPR compliance, data cleanup |
| `FORGET_MODE_OVERWRITE` | Partial | Replace with new content | Memory reconsolidation |

#### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `memory_space_id` | string | No | Memory space identifier |
| `memory_id` | string | Yes* | Specific memory to forget |
| `pattern` | object | Yes* | Pattern of memories to forget |
| `mode` | enum | Yes | Forgetting mode (see above) |

*Either `memory_id` or `pattern` required, not both.

#### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "memories_affected": 1,
  "forget_confidence": {
    "value": 0.95,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_CERTAIN",
    "reasoning": "Memory suppressed, activation reduced to 0.1"
  },
  "reversible": true
}

```

#### Pattern Forgetting

Forget multiple memories matching a pattern:

```json
{
  "memory_space_id": "default",
  "pattern": {
    "semantic": {
      "query": "outdated Python 2 information"
    }
  },
  "mode": "FORGET_MODE_SUPPRESS"
}

```

This reduces activation for all memories matching the pattern, useful for deprecating old information without deleting it permanently.

### POST /api/v1/memories/recognize

Check if a memory pattern feels familiar (recognition vs recall).

Recognition is cognitively easier than recall - it's the difference between "Have I seen this before?" versus "What did I learn yesterday?"

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/recognize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "content": "Python was created by Guido van Rossum",
    "recognition_threshold": 0.8
  }'

```

#### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "recognized": true,
  "recognition_confidence": {
    "value": 0.94,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_HIGH",
    "reasoning": "Strong match with existing memory (similarity: 0.96)"
  },
  "similar_memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4",
      "content": "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991",
      "similarity": 0.96
    }
  ],
  "familiarity_score": 0.94
}

```

Use recognition for:

- Deduplication before storing new memories

- "Have we seen this before?" checks

- Validating memory accuracy

## Episodic Operations

Episodic memories encode rich contextual information following the what/when/where/who/why/how structure from memory research.

### POST /api/v1/episodes/experience

Record a new episodic memory with full context.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/episodes/experience \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "episode": {
      "what": "Learned about memory consolidation during sleep",
      "when": "2024-10-27T09:00:00Z",
      "where_location": "neuroscience lecture hall",
      "who": ["Dr. Smith", "classmates"],
      "why": "preparing for exam",
      "how": "attended lecture and took notes",
      "emotional_valence": 0.6,
      "importance": 0.8,
      "embedding": [0.15, -0.42, ...]
    },
    "immediate_consolidation": false,
    "context_links": ["mem_related_concept_1", "mem_related_concept_2"]
  }'

```

#### Request Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `episode.what` | string | Yes | Core event description |
| `episode.when` | timestamp | Yes | When it occurred |
| `episode.where_location` | string | No | Where it occurred |
| `episode.who` | string[] | No | Who was involved |
| `episode.why` | string | No | Why it happened |
| `episode.how` | string | No | How it happened |
| `episode.emotional_valence` | float | No | Emotion [-1.0 to 1.0] |

| `episode.embedding` | float[] | Yes | 768-dimensional semantic vector |
| `immediate_consolidation` | boolean | No | Consolidate immediately (default: false) |
| `context_links` | string[] | No | Link to contextual memories |

#### Response (201 Created)

```json
{
  "episode_id": "ep_1698765432_x1y2z3",
  "encoding_quality": {
    "value": 0.92,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_HIGH",
    "reasoning": "Rich contextual encoding with 5/6 fields populated"
  },
  "state": "CONSOLIDATION_STATE_RECENT",
  "context_links_created": 2
}

```

#### Why Episodic Encoding Matters

Research shows episodic memories with rich context have:

- 67% better retrieval success

- 3x longer retention periods

- More resistant to interference

The what/when/where/who/why/how structure follows Tulving's episodic memory theory.

### POST /api/v1/episodes/reminisce

Retrieve episodic memories using contextual cues.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/episodes/reminisce \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "about_topic": "neuroscience lectures",
    "time_window_start": "2024-10-01T00:00:00Z",
    "time_window_end": "2024-10-31T23:59:59Z",
    "at_location": "lecture hall",
    "include_emotional": true
  }'

```

#### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "episodes": [
    {
      "id": "ep_1698765432_x1y2z3",
      "when": "2024-10-27T09:00:00Z",
      "what": "Learned about memory consolidation during sleep",
      "where_location": "neuroscience lecture hall",
      "who": ["Dr. Smith", "classmates"],
      "encoding_confidence": {
        "value": 0.92,
        "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_HIGH"
      }
    }
  ],
  "recall_vividness": {
    "value": 0.87,
    "category": "CONFIDENCE_CATEGORY_HIGH",
    "reasoning": "Recent memories with strong contextual cues"
  },
  "emotional_summary": {
    "mean_valence": 0.55,
    "valence_variance": 0.12,
    "dominant_emotion": "engaged"
  },
  "memory_themes": [
    "learning",
    "neuroscience",
    "academic",
    "preparation"
  ]
}

```

#### Emotional Summary

When `include_emotional: true`, Engram aggregates emotional valence across episodes:

- **mean_valence**: Average emotion [-1.0 to 1.0]

- **valence_variance**: How much emotions varied

- **dominant_emotion**: Inferred emotional category

#### Memory Themes

Themes emerge from clustering episode content, not from explicit tags. This models how your brain naturally categorizes experiences.

## Consolidation Operations

Memory consolidation transforms recent, fragile memories into stable long-term storage, following sleep research.

### POST /api/v1/consolidation/consolidate

Trigger memory consolidation process.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/consolidation/consolidate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "criteria": {
      "older_than": "2024-10-26T00:00:00Z",
      "importance_threshold": 0.5,
      "types": ["MEMORY_TYPE_EPISODIC", "MEMORY_TYPE_SEMANTIC"]
    },
    "mode": "CONSOLIDATION_MODE_SYNAPTIC"
  }'

```

#### Consolidation Modes

| Mode | Speed | Scope | Use Case |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| `CONSOLIDATION_MODE_SYNAPTIC` | Fast (seconds) | Local connections | Recent memories, quick strengthening |
| `CONSOLIDATION_MODE_SYSTEMS` | Slow (minutes) | Distributed patterns | Deep integration, schema formation |
| `CONSOLIDATION_MODE_RECONSOLIDATION` | Medium | Existing memories | Update/modify stable memories |

#### Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "memories_consolidated": 342,
  "new_associations": 89,
  "state_changes": {
    "mem_1698765432_a1b2c3d4": "CONSOLIDATION_STATE_CONSOLIDATED",
    "mem_1698765001_x1y2z3": "CONSOLIDATION_STATE_CONSOLIDATED"
  },
  "next_consolidation": "2024-10-27T18:00:00Z"
}

```

#### When to Consolidate

- **Nightly**: Systems consolidation during low-traffic periods (like sleep)

- **Hourly**: Synaptic consolidation for recent important memories

- **On-demand**: After batch imports or major knowledge updates

### POST /api/v1/consolidation/dream

Stream dream-like memory replay for insight generation.

This endpoint streams consolidation events in real-time, showing memory replay sequences and emerging insights. Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for browser consumption.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/consolidation/dream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "default",
    "replay_cycles": 10,
    "creativity_factor": 0.7,
    "generate_insights": true
  }'

```

#### Response (200 OK, streaming)

```
event: replay
data: {"memory_ids": ["mem_1", "mem_2", "mem_3"], "sequence_novelty": 0.65, "narrative": "Connection between Python history and memory systems"}

event: insight
data: {"description": "Both Python and Engram prioritize developer experience", "connected_memories": ["mem_1", "mem_5"], "confidence": {"value": 0.78}, "suggested_action": "Create explicit link"}

event: progress
data: {"memories_replayed": 25, "new_connections": 7, "consolidation_strength": 0.82}

event: replay
data: {"memory_ids": ["mem_4", "mem_6"], "sequence_novelty": 0.89, "narrative": "Novel connection between unrelated concepts"}

event: done
data: {"total_replayed": 50, "total_insights": 3, "total_connections": 12}

```

#### Stream Event Types

- **replay**: Memory sequence being replayed

- **insight**: Novel connection discovered

- **progress**: Consolidation progress update

- **done**: Stream completion summary

#### Creativity Factor

Controls how much dream replay explores novel vs familiar connections:

- `0.0`: Conservative, strengthen existing connections

- `0.5`: Balanced exploration and exploitation

- `1.0`: Creative, maximize novel connections

Higher creativity can discover unexpected insights but may create spurious associations.

## Pattern Operations

Pattern completion reconstructs full memories from partial cues, modeling tip-of-the-tongue experiences.

### POST /api/v1/patterns/complete

Complete partial memory patterns.

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/patterns/complete \

## Error Handling

All errors follow a consistent structure with educational messages. See [Error Codes Reference](/reference/error-codes.md) for complete catalog.

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERR-2003",
    "summary": "Activation spreading timeout",
    "context": "Spreading activation did not converge within 5000ms. Started from 1 seed memory, reached 45,123 nodes before timeout.",
    "suggestion": "Reduce max_hops (currently: unlimited) or increase activation_decay (currently: 0.1). For broad queries, consider using pattern completion instead of full spreading.",
    "example": {
      "current": "recall(cue, spread_activation=true)",
      "recommended": "recall(cue, spread_activation=true, max_hops=3, activation_decay=0.3)"
    },
    "error_confidence": {
      "value": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Timeout threshold exceeded, activation log shows divergence pattern"
    },
    "similar_errors": [
      "ERR-2004: Invalid similarity threshold",
      "ERR-5001: Storage tier unavailable"
    ]
  }
}

```

### Common Errors

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|------------|---------|--------|
| 400 | ERR-1001 | Embedding dimension mismatch | Verify embedding size is 768 |
| 400 | ERR-1002 | Invalid confidence value | Ensure confidence in [0.0, 1.0] |
| 404 | ERR-1003 | Memory space not found | Check memory_space_id |
| 409 | ERR-3001 | Consolidation in progress | Wait for completion or cancel |
| 429 | ERR-5003 | Rate limit exceeded | Implement exponential backoff |
| 503 | ERR-5004 | Service unavailable | Check system health via /introspect |

## Rate Limiting

Rate limits protect system performance and ensure fair resource allocation.

### Limits by Endpoint

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Burst |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| `/memories/remember` | 100/sec | 1s | 150 |
| `/memories/recall` | 50/sec | 1s | 75 |
| `/consolidation/consolidate` | 10/min | 1m | 15 |
| `/consolidation/dream` | 5/min | 1m | 5 |
| `/introspect` | 20/sec | 1s | 30 |

### Rate Limit Headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 87
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1698765432

```

When rate limited:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERR-5003",
    "summary": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "context": "100 requests in last second (limit: 100/sec)",
    "suggestion": "Implement exponential backoff or use gRPC streaming for batch operations",
    "retry_after_seconds": 1
  }
}

```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Targets (P99)

| Operation | Target | Actual | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Remember (single) | <50ms | 45ms | Hot tier storage |
| Recall (10 results) | <150ms | 120ms | With spreading activation |
| Forget (single) | <30ms | 25ms | Suppression mode |
| Consolidate (1000 memories) | <5s | 4.2s | Synaptic mode |
| Pattern complete | <100ms | 85ms | Single completion |

### Throughput (single instance)

| Operation | Throughput | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Remember | 80/sec | REST unary |
| Recall | 45/sec | REST unary |
| Remember (gRPC stream) | 390/sec | 4.9x faster |
| Recall (gRPC stream) | 160/sec | 3.6x faster |

### When to Use gRPC

Switch to [gRPC API](/reference/grpc-api.md) when:

- Throughput requirement >100 req/sec

- Batch operations (>10 memories)

- Streaming consolidation needed

- Mobile/edge deployments (binary efficiency)

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

Each API key is scoped to a memory space for tenant isolation.

### Explicit Memory Space

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/remember \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory_space_id": "tenant_42_memories",
    "memory": {...}
  }'

```

Server validates JWT claim matches `memory_space_id`. Returns `ERR-4004` if mismatch.

### Default Memory Space

Omit `memory_space_id` to use authenticated user's default space:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/memories/remember \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
    "memory": {...}
  }'

```

## Neo4j Migration Guide

Coming from Neo4j? Here's how Engram concepts map:

| Neo4j | Engram | Key Difference |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| `CREATE (n:Node)` | `POST /memories/remember` | Automatic relationship creation |
| `MATCH (n) WHERE ...` | `POST /memories/recall` | Confidence scoring, not exact match |
| `DELETE (n)` | `POST /memories/forget` | Gradual/reversible forgetting |
| `MERGE` | `POST /memories/recognize` then `remember` | Recognition check first |
| Cypher query | Natural language cue | Probabilistic vs deterministic |
| Relationship | Association with type | Typed, weighted, confidence-scored |

See [Database Migration Guide](/operations/database-migration.md) for detailed migration examples.
