# Example 04: Pattern Completion

**Learning Goal**: Use partial cues to complete memory patterns through spreading activation.

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 15 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of spreading activation

## Cognitive Concept

Pattern completion is like finishing someone's sentence - given a partial input, your brain activates the most likely completion:

```
Input:  "The mitochondria is the..."
Output: "...powerhouse of the cell" (high confidence)
```

Engram uses spreading activation to find the most coherent completion based on semantic similarity and past reinforcement.

## What You'll Learn

- Complete patterns with `complete()`
- Control completion parameters (beam search, temperature)
- Handle multiple plausible completions
- Understand completion confidence

## Example Use Cases

- Autocomplete: Suggest memory completions
- Query expansion: Broaden search from partial input
- Memory reconstruction: Fill in forgotten details
- Associative chains: "This reminds me of..."

## Code Examples

See language-specific implementations in this directory:

- `rust.rs` - Rust with confidence thresholding
- `python.py` - Python with beam search
- `typescript.ts` - TypeScript with ranking
- `go.go` - Go with parallel completion
- `java.java` - Java with candidate filtering

## Tuning Parameters

- `beam_width`: Number of candidates to explore (default: 5)
- `temperature`: Randomness in selection (default: 0.7)
- `max_completions`: Maximum results to return (default: 3)
- `min_confidence`: Filter low-confidence completions (default: 0.5)
