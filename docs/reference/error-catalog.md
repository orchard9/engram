# Error Catalog

This document catalogs all error messages in Engram's query language with explanations, causes, and solutions.

## Error Philosophy

Engram's error messages follow psychological research principles:
- **Clear**: No parser jargon (no "AST", "token stream", "lookahead")
- **Actionable**: Every error tells you what to do next
- **Examples**: Show correct syntax (recognition beats recall)
- **Positive**: "Use X" not "Don't use Y"
- **Stress-aware**: Clear even when tired (the "3am test")

Every error includes:
1. Exact position (line and column)
2. What was found vs. expected
3. Actionable suggestion
4. Example of correct syntax

## Tokenization Errors

Errors that occur while converting characters to tokens.

### Unexpected Character

**When it happens:** Invalid character in query

**Example:**
```
WHERE confidence @ 0.7
                  ^
```

**Error message:**
```
Unexpected character '@' at line 1, column 18

Suggestion: Remove '@' or check query syntax. Valid characters: letters, digits, _, >, <, =, [, ], ,
Example: RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

**Common causes:**
- Special characters from copy-paste (`@`, `$`, `%`, `#`)
- Wrong comparison operators (use `>` not `@`)
- Stray punctuation

**How to fix:**
Remove the invalid character or replace with valid syntax.

---

### Unterminated String

**When it happens:** String literal missing closing quote

**Example:**
```
RECALL "neural networks
```

**Error message:**
```
String literal not closed with " at line 1, column 8

Suggestion: Add closing " to string literal
Example: RECALL "my episode"
```

**Common causes:**
- Forgot closing quote
- Newline inside string (not supported)
- Copy-paste missing end

**How to fix:**
Add the closing `"` character.

---

### Invalid Number

**When it happens:** Malformed numeric literal

**Examples:**
```
CONFIDENCE > 1.2.3
THRESHOLD 999999999999999999999
MAX_HOPS 1.5
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid number '1.2.3' at line 1, column 14

Suggestion: Use format: 123 (integer) or 0.5 (float)
Example: WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

**Common causes:**
- Multiple decimal points (`1.2.3`)
- Number overflow
- Float where integer expected (MAX_HOPS)

**How to fix:**
Use valid number format. Note that MAX_HOPS requires an integer.

---

### Invalid Escape Sequence

**When it happens:** Unknown escape in string literal

**Example:**
```
RECALL "path\file"
            ^
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid escape sequence '\f' at line 1, column 13

Suggestion: Replace '\f' with valid escape or remove backslash
Example: RECALL "line one\nline two"
```

**Valid escapes:**
- `\n` - newline
- `\t` - tab
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\"` - quote
- `\\` - backslash

**Common causes:**
- Windows paths (use `\\` or raw strings)
- Unknown escape codes

**How to fix:**
Use valid escape sequence or double backslashes: `"path\\file"`

---

## Parse Errors

Errors that occur while building the query structure.

### Unknown Keyword

**When it happens:** Typo in keyword or unrecognized operation

**Examples with suggestions:**
```
RECAL episode          -> Did you mean: RECALL?
SPRED FROM node        -> Did you mean: SPREAD?
IMAGINЕ concept        -> Did you mean: IMAGINE?
CONSOLDATE episode     -> Did you mean: CONSOLIDATE?
PREDCIT state          -> Did you mean: PREDICT?
WHER confidence > 0.7  -> Did you mean: WHERE?
CONFIDENSE > 0.8       -> Did you mean: CONFIDENCE?
THRESHHOLD 0.9         -> Did you mean: THRESHOLD?
```

**Error message:**
```
Unknown keyword 'RECAL' at line 1, column 1
Did you mean 'RECALL'?

Suggestion: Use keyword RECALL
Example: RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

**How to fix:**
Use the suggested correct spelling. The system uses Levenshtein distance (≤2) to detect typos.

---

### Unexpected Token

**When it happens:** Token appears in wrong position

**Example 1: Missing pattern**
```
RECALL WHERE confidence > 0.7
       ^
```

**Error message:**
```
Parse error at line 1, column 8:
  Found: WHERE
  Expected: identifier or embedding [...] or string literal

Suggestion: RECALL requires a pattern: node ID, embedding vector, or content match
Example: RECALL episode_123
```

**Example 2: Wrong operation start**
```
WHERE confidence > 0.7
^
```

**Error message:**
```
Parse error at line 1, column 1:
  Found: WHERE
  Expected: RECALL, PREDICT, IMAGINE, CONSOLIDATE, SPREAD

Suggestion: Query must start with a cognitive operation keyword
Example: RECALL episode WHERE confidence > 0.7
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing required token
- Token in wrong order
- Started query with constraint instead of operation

**How to fix:**
Follow the suggested syntax structure.

---

### Unexpected EOF

**When it happens:** Query ends too early

**Examples:**
```
RECALL
SPREAD FROM
PREDICT episode GIVEN
```

**Error message:**
```
Query ended unexpectedly at line 1, column 7

Suggestion: RECALL requires a pattern: node ID, embedding vector, or content match
Example: RECALL episode_123
```

**Common causes:**
- Incomplete query
- Accidentally deleted part of query
- Hit enter too early

**How to fix:**
Complete the query based on the suggestion.

---

## Validation Errors

Errors in query semantics (syntax is valid but meaning is invalid).

### Empty Embedding

**When it happens:** Embedding vector has no elements

**Example:**
```
RECALL []
```

**Error message:**
```
Empty embedding vector at line 1, column 8

Suggestion: Provide at least one number in embedding
Example: RECALL [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
```

**How to fix:**
Provide a non-empty embedding vector (typically 768 dimensions).

---

### Invalid Embedding Dimension

**When it happens:** Embedding has wrong number of dimensions

**Example:**
```rust
// In code, not query string
Pattern::Embedding {
    vector: vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3],  // Wrong! Should be 768
    threshold: 0.8,
}
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid embedding dimension: expected 768, got 3

Suggestion: Ensure embedding model matches system configuration
Example: Use text-embedding-ada-002 or compatible 768-dim model
```

**System expectation:** Exactly 768 dimensions

**How to fix:**
Use a 768-dimensional embedding from a compatible model.

---

### Invalid Threshold

**When it happens:** Similarity/activation threshold out of range

**Examples:**
```
RECALL [0.1, 0.2, ...] THRESHOLD 1.5
SPREAD FROM node THRESHOLD -0.1
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid similarity threshold: 1.5, must be in [0,1]

Suggestion: Use 0.7-0.9 for strict matching, 0.5-0.7 for fuzzy matching
Example: Pattern::Embedding { vector, threshold: 0.8 }
```

**Valid range:** 0.0 to 1.0

**Common values:**
- 0.9-0.95: Very strict matching
- 0.7-0.9: Standard similarity
- 0.5-0.7: Fuzzy matching
- Below 0.5: Very loose (often too many results)

**How to fix:**
Use value between 0.0 and 1.0.

---

### Empty Node ID

**When it happens:** Node identifier is empty string

**Example:**
```rust
NodeIdentifier::from("")
```

**Error message:**
```
Empty node identifier

Suggestion: Use meaningful IDs like 'episode_123' or 'concept_ai'
Example: NodeIdentifier::from("episode_123")
```

**How to fix:**
Provide non-empty node identifier.

---

### Node ID Too Long

**When it happens:** Node identifier exceeds 256 bytes

**Error message:**
```
Node identifier too long: 300 bytes (max 256)

Suggestion: Use shorter, more compact identifiers
Example: Use 'usr_123' instead of full UUIDs
```

**Limit:** 256 bytes

**How to fix:**
Use shorter identifiers or hash long IDs.

---

### Empty Content Match

**When it happens:** Content match pattern is empty

**Example:**
```
RECALL ""
```

**Error message:**
```
Empty content match pattern

Suggestion: Provide text to match against memory content
Example: Pattern::ContentMatch("neural network")
```

**How to fix:**
Provide non-empty search text.

---

### Invalid Confidence Interval

**When it happens:** Lower bound > upper bound

**Example:**
```rust
ConfidenceInterval::new(
    Confidence::from_raw(0.9),  // lower
    Confidence::from_raw(0.5)   // upper - WRONG!
)
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid confidence interval: lower=0.9 > upper=0.5

Suggestion: Swap values or use ConfidenceInterval::new() for validation
Example: ConfidenceInterval::new(0.5, 0.9)
```

**How to fix:**
Ensure lower ≤ upper.

---

### Invalid Decay Rate

**When it happens:** Decay rate out of range

**Example:**
```
SPREAD FROM node DECAY 1.5
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid decay rate: 1.5, must be in [0,1]

Suggestion: Use 0.1 for slow forgetting, 0.3-0.5 for typical decay
Example: SpreadQuery { decay_rate: Some(0.1), .. }
```

**Valid range:** 0.0 (no decay) to 1.0 (instant decay)

**Typical values:**
- 0.05-0.1: Very slow decay (wide spreading)
- 0.1-0.3: Moderate decay (typical use)
- 0.3-0.5: Fast decay (focused spreading)
- Above 0.5: Very fast decay (rarely useful)

**How to fix:**
Use value between 0.0 and 1.0.

---

### Invalid Activation Threshold

**When it happens:** Activation threshold out of range

**Example:**
```
SPREAD FROM node THRESHOLD 2.0
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid activation threshold: 2.0, must be in [0,1]

Suggestion: Use 0.01 for wide spreading, 0.1 for focused activation
Example: SpreadQuery { activation_threshold: Some(0.01), .. }
```

**Valid range:** 0.0 to 1.0

**Typical values:**
- 0.001-0.01: Wide spreading (many nodes)
- 0.01-0.1: Moderate spreading (typical use)
- 0.1-0.3: Focused spreading (strong connections only)
- Above 0.3: Very focused (rarely useful)

**How to fix:**
Use value between 0.0 and 1.0.

---

### Invalid Novelty Level

**When it happens:** Novelty parameter out of range

**Example:**
```
IMAGINE concept NOVELTY 1.5
```

**Error message:**
```
Invalid novelty level: 1.5, must be in [0,1]

Suggestion: Use 0.3-0.5 for moderate creativity
Example: ImagineQuery { novelty: Some(0.4), .. }
```

**Valid range:** 0.0 (conservative) to 1.0 (highly creative)

**Typical values:**
- 0.0-0.3: Conservative (stay close to known patterns)
- 0.3-0.5: Moderate creativity (balanced)
- 0.5-0.7: Creative (explore new combinations)
- 0.7-1.0: Highly creative (distant associations)

**How to fix:**
Use value between 0.0 and 1.0.

---

### MAX_HOPS Out of Range

**When it happens:** Hop count exceeds u16 range

**Example:**
```
SPREAD FROM node MAX_HOPS 100000
```

**Error message:**
```
MAX_HOPS value 100000 out of range (max 65535)

Suggestion: Use value between 0 and 65535
Example: SPREAD FROM node MAX_HOPS 10
```

**Valid range:** 0 to 65,535

**Typical values:**
- 2-3: Focused, fast queries
- 4-5: Moderate exploration
- 6-10: Wide exploration
- Above 10: Usually impractical (exponential cost)

**How to fix:**
Use smaller hop count (typically 2-5).

---

## Context-Specific Guidance

### After RECALL

**Expected:** Pattern (node ID, embedding, or content string)

**Valid:**
```
RECALL episode_123
RECALL [0.1, 0.2, ...]
RECALL "search text"
```

**Invalid:**
```
RECALL WHERE ...     // Missing pattern
RECALL FROM ...      // Wrong keyword (FROM is for SPREAD)
```

---

### After SPREAD

**Expected:** FROM keyword then node ID

**Valid:**
```
SPREAD FROM node_123
SPREAD FROM episode MAX_HOPS 5
```

**Invalid:**
```
SPREAD node_123      // Missing FROM
SPREAD GIVEN ...     // Wrong keyword (GIVEN is for PREDICT)
```

---

### After PREDICT

**Expected:** Pattern then GIVEN then context nodes

**Valid:**
```
PREDICT next GIVEN current
PREDICT state GIVEN ctx1, ctx2
```

**Invalid:**
```
PREDICT next         // Missing GIVEN
PREDICT GIVEN ...    // Missing pattern before GIVEN
```

---

### After IMAGINE

**Expected:** Pattern, optionally BASED ON with seeds

**Valid:**
```
IMAGINE concept
IMAGINE hybrid BASED ON seed1, seed2
```

**Invalid:**
```
IMAGINE BASED ON ... // Missing pattern before BASED ON
IMAGINE FROM ...     // Wrong keyword (FROM is for SPREAD)
```

---

### After CONSOLIDATE

**Expected:** Episode selector then INTO then target node

**Valid:**
```
CONSOLIDATE episode INTO target
CONSOLIDATE WHERE ... INTO target
```

**Invalid:**
```
CONSOLIDATE INTO ... // Missing episode selector
CONSOLIDATE episode  // Missing INTO
```

---

### In WHERE Clause

**Expected:** Field name, operator, value

**Valid:**
```
WHERE confidence > 0.7
WHERE content CONTAINS "text"
WHERE created BEFORE "2024-01-01"
```

**Invalid:**
```
WHERE > 0.7          // Missing field name
WHERE confidence     // Missing operator and value
```

---

## Error Recovery Strategies

### For Typos

The parser detects typos using Levenshtein distance. If you see "Did you mean...?", use the suggested spelling.

**All detected typos:**
- RECAL → RECALL
- SPRED, SPRAED → SPREAD
- PREDCIT, PREDUCT → PREDICT
- IMAGINЕ, IMAGNE → IMAGINE
- CONSOLDATE, CONSOLIDTE → CONSOLIDATE
- WHER, WHRE → WHERE
- CONFIDENSE, CONFIDANCE → CONFIDENCE
- THRESHHOLD, THRESOLD → THRESHOLD
- GVEN, GIVN → GIVEN
- FORM, FRON → FROM
- BASD → BASED
- INTI, INOT → INTO

### For Structure Errors

1. Read the example in the error message
2. Compare with your query
3. Fix the structure to match the example
4. Remember: operation first, then pattern, then modifiers

### For Range Errors

All numeric parameters have documented ranges:
- Confidence/threshold: [0.0, 1.0]
- Decay rate: [0.0, 1.0]
- Novelty: [0.0, 1.0]
- MAX_HOPS: [0, 65535]

When in doubt, use the typical values listed in error messages.

## Testing Your Queries

### Quick Validation Checklist

Before running a query:
1. Does it start with an operation keyword? (RECALL, SPREAD, etc.)
2. Does the pattern come right after the operation?
3. Are all keywords spelled correctly?
4. Are all numeric values in valid ranges?
5. Are strings properly quoted?
6. Does the structure match an example from docs?

### Common Mistakes

**1. Missing Pattern**
```
RECALL WHERE ...  // WRONG
RECALL episode WHERE ...  // CORRECT
```

**2. Wrong Keyword Order**
```
SPREAD node FROM  // WRONG
SPREAD FROM node  // CORRECT
```

**3. Unquoted Strings**
```
RECALL neural networks  // WRONG (treated as two identifiers)
RECALL "neural networks"  // CORRECT
```

**4. Out of Range Values**
```
CONFIDENCE > 1.5  // WRONG (> 1.0)
CONFIDENCE > 0.9  // CORRECT
```

**5. Wrong Operator**
```
confidence = 0.7  // Currently unsupported (use > or <)
confidence > 0.7  // CORRECT
```
