## Architecture Achievements

### Lock-Free Streaming Infrastructure
- **ObservationQueue**: SegQueue with 4M+ ops/sec
- **SessionManager**: DashMap for concurrent sessions
- **BackpressureMonitor**: Atomic state tracking
- **WorkerPool**: Space-partitioned for zero contention

### Space-Partitioned HNSW
**Key Decision**: After Task 004 validation showed concurrent HNSW only achieves 1,957 ops/sec (30x below target), implemented space-partitioned architecture:
- Each MemorySpaceId gets independent HNSW index
- Zero cross-space contention
- Linear scaling by space count
- Expected performance: 1,664 ops/sec √ó N spaces

### Snapshot Isolation
- Generation-based filtering for consistent recall
- Atomic operations with SeqCst ordering
- Out-of-order commit handling
- Confidence adjustment within staleness bounds

### Chaos Engineering
- Research-validated fault injection
- Eventual consistency validation
- Graph integrity checking
- Deterministic reproduction

---

## Critical Decisions Documented

### 1. Space Partitioning Over Shared HNSW
**Evidence**: Task 004 benchmark results
**Decision**: Space-partitioned HNSW architecture
**Rationale**: Structural contention in SkipMap/DashMap under concurrent writes
**Impact**: Linear scaling achievable with multiple active spaces

### 2. Eventual Consistency Model
**Basis**: Biological memory model from vision.md
**Implementation**: Bounded staleness (P99 < 100ms)
**Trade-off**: Not linearizable, appropriate for cognitive systems

### 3. Milestone 14 Postponement
**Analysis**: systems-product-planner identified critical issues
**Findings**: Underestimated 5-6x, missing prerequisites
**Recommendation**: Complete M11 first, establish baselines, prove consolidation determinism
**Impact**: Prevents 3-4 months of wasted effort on premature distribution

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Parallel Agent Execution**
   - Deployed 5 agents simultaneously
   - Maximized throughput
   - Reduced wall-clock time

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Each agent focused on their expertise
   - rust-graph-engine-architect excelled at concurrent code
   - verification-testing-lead created comprehensive test specs

3. **Validation Before Implementation**
   - Task 004 validation prevented wasted effort
   - Benchmark results drove architecture decision
   - Space partitioning was the right choice

4. **Comprehensive Specifications**
   - Created detailed implementation guides
   - Future work is well-documented
   - Easy to resume/delegate

### Challenges Encountered

1. **API Errors**
   - Task 008 agent hit 500 error
   - Recoverable, can resume
   - Need retry logic

2. **Compilation Time**
   - Large Rust codebase takes time
   - Slows iteration
   - Could use incremental compilation

3. **Dependency Issues**
   - WebSocket test had compilation errors
   - Needed dependency updates
   - Version pinning would help

### Recommendations

1. **For M11 Completion**
   - Prioritize Tasks 007-008 (core functionality)
   - Then 010-012 (validation/production)
   - 8.5 days single engineer

2. **For M14 Planning**
   - DO NOT proceed with current plan
   - Complete M11 first
   - Establish single-node baselines
   - Prove consolidation determinism
   - Restart with simplified static replication

3. **For Future Milestones**
   - Always validate performance assumptions early
   - Use benchmarks to drive architecture decisions
   - Don't distribute prematurely
   - Measure before optimizing
