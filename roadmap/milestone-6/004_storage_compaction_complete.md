## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: StorageCompactor Core (Completed 2025-10-19)
- **NEW (2025-10-19)**: Storage compaction module implemented in `engram-core/src/consolidation/compaction.rs`
  - `StorageCompactor` struct with configurable compaction behavior
  - `CompactionConfig` with min_episode_age (7 days default), preserve_threshold (0.95), and reconstruction_threshold (0.8)
  - `verify_reconstruction()` validates semantic memory can reconstruct episodes with â‰¥0.8 similarity before deletion
  - `is_episode_eligible()` checks both age and confidence criteria to protect high-value memories
  - `compute_storage_reduction()` calculates storage savings from replacing episodes with semantic patterns
  - `compact_storage()` orchestrates full compaction process with 5-phase safety verification
  - `CompactionResult` tracks episodes_removed, storage_reduction_bytes, and average_similarity
- **Comprehensive unit test coverage** with 12 unit tests, all passing

### Phase 2: MemoryStore Integration (Completed 2025-10-19)
- **MemoryStore integration methods** implemented in `engram-core/src/store.rs`:
  - `store_semantic_pattern()`: Stores semantic patterns with high activation (0.9)
  - `mark_episodes_consolidated()`: Marks episodes as consolidated (returns count)
  - `remove_consolidated_episodes()`: Hard deletes consolidated episodes from all indices
- **Integration test suite** with 9 comprehensive tests in `engram-core/tests/storage_compaction_tests.rs`:
  - Semantic pattern storage and high activation verification
  - Episode marking and removal operations
  - Rollback on poor similarity (< 0.8 threshold)
  - Preservation of high-confidence episodes (> 0.95)
  - Preservation of recent episodes (< 7 days)
  - Empty episode list handling
  - Full compaction pipeline with storage reduction
  - All tests passing with zero clippy warnings
- **Compaction metrics** tracking (5 new metrics):
  - COMPACTION_ATTEMPTS_TOTAL
  - COMPACTION_SUCCESS_TOTAL
  - COMPACTION_ROLLBACK_TOTAL
  - COMPACTION_EPISODES_REMOVED
  - COMPACTION_STORAGE_SAVED_BYTES

### Quality Assurance
- Zero clippy warnings after `make quality`
- All workspace tests passing
- Ready for integration with Dream Operation (Task 005)

## Integration Points for Task 005 (Dream Operation)

Task 005 will use the completed storage compaction infrastructure to:
- Call `StorageCompactor::compact_storage()` during dream cycles
- Use the MemoryStore integration methods (`store_semantic_pattern()`, `mark_episodes_consolidated()`, `remove_consolidated_episodes()`) to execute compaction
- Track compaction metrics through the existing metrics infrastructure
- Emit compaction events as BeliefUpdateRecords for observability

## Notes
- Design should integrate with `ConsolidationService` so compaction operates on cached snapshots rather than rebuilding from scratch.
- Use soak baseline (`docs/assets/consolidation/baseline/`) to validate compaction does not regress belief metrics.
- Coordinate with Task 006 to ensure compaction events emit observability signals (metrics + belief-update logs).
- Currently using existing `SemanticPattern` type from `completion/consolidation.rs` as the semantic memory representation.
