# Task 006: Consolidation Metrics Observability

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
1 days

## Dependencies
- Task 005

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 006).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Current Progress
- `/api/v1/consolidations` and `/api/v1/consolidations/{id}` now expose semantic belief snapshots with citation trails, schema confidence, and freshness metrics.
- Consolidation SSE stream emits `belief`, `progress`, and keepalive events with novelty thresholds and consolidation run statistics.
- Temporal provenance (`observed_at`, `stored_at`, `last_access`) is available in write and recall responses to support drift monitoring.

## Remaining Work
- Persist consolidation run metrics and belief update deltas into the metrics registry/export pipeline for long-term alerting.
- Document alert thresholds (failed_consolidations spikes, stale beliefs) and operator responses in Task 006 playbooks.
- Add integration coverage for the new metrics exports once persistence is wired in.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Notes
This task file provides summary information. Complete implementation-ready specifications are in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md.
