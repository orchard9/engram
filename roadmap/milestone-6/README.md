# Milestone 6: Consolidation System - Implementation Overview

## Executive Summary

Milestone 6 implements `consolidate_async()` and `dream()` operations that transform episodic memories into semantic knowledge through unsupervised statistical pattern detection, achieving >50% storage reduction while maintaining >95% recall accuracy.

## Critical Path Analysis

**Total Duration:** 16 days
**Parallel Track Utilization:** Single critical path (sequential dependencies)

### Phase Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Scheduler Foundation (Days 1-3)** - Task 001: Consolidation Scheduler
- **Phase 2: Pattern Detection (Days 4-7)** - Task 002: Pattern Detection Engine
- **Phase 3: Semantic Extraction (Days 8-10)** - Task 003: Semantic Memory Extraction
- **Phase 4: Storage & Dream (Days 11-13)** - Tasks 004-005
- **Phase 5: Production (Days 14-16)** - Tasks 006-007

## Task Dependencies

```
001 (Scheduler) → 002 (Pattern Detection) → 003 (Semantic Extraction)
                                           ↓
004 (Storage Compaction) → 005 (Dream Operation) → 006 (Metrics) → 007 (Validation)
```

## Performance Targets Summary

| Component | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Consolidation Cycle | Non-blocking | Zero impact on recall latency |
| Pattern Detection | <1s | 1000 episodes |
| Storage Reduction | >50% | After consolidation |
| Retrieval Accuracy | >95% | Post-consolidation |
| Dream Cycle | 10-20x faster | Replay speed vs real-time |
| Memory Overhead | <100MB | Bounded growth over 1000 cycles |

## Success Metrics

### Storage & Efficiency
- Storage reduction >50% on test datasets
- Consolidation never blocks recall operations
- Memory usage bounded (<100MB drift over 1000 cycles)
- Graceful shutdown interrupts cleanly

### Accuracy & Quality
- Retrieval accuracy >95% post-consolidation
- Pattern detection identifies structures in >80% of datasets
- Semantic memories preserve meaning (human evaluation >80% acceptable)
- Statistical significance filtering (p < 0.01) prevents spurious patterns

### Biological Plausibility
- Dream replay 10-20x faster than encoding
- Sharp-wave ripple frequency 150-250 Hz
- Hippocampal replay during offline periods
- Complementary learning systems theory alignment

## Integration with Existing System

Milestone 6 builds on consolidation stub:
- Extends `ConsolidationEngine` from `completion/consolidation.rs`
- Uses existing replay buffer mechanisms
- Integrates with tiered storage from Milestone 2
- Connects to metrics registry from Milestone 1

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items (P0)
- **Consolidation Blocking**: Interruptibility mechanism with yield points
- **Data Loss**: Verification steps before deletion, soft delete before hard delete
- **Spurious Patterns**: Statistical significance filtering (p < 0.01)

### Medium-Risk Items (P1)
- **Performance Impact**: Idle detection, query rate monitoring
- **Memory Growth**: Bounded pattern cache, periodic cleanup
- **Reconstruction Accuracy**: Validation tests before compaction

## Next Steps

1. **Review** MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete technical specifications
2. **Begin** with Task 001 (Consolidation Scheduler)
3. **Monitor** storage reduction and accuracy metrics
4. **Tune** parameters based on workload characteristics
5. **Validate** with human evaluation of semantic quality
