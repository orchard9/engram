# Task 005: Dream Operation

## Status
PENDING

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
3 days

## Dependencies
- Task 004

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 005).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Notes
- Leverage the new consolidation service to schedule "dream" runs without blocking regular consolidation; ensure outputs feed belief logs/metrics the same way scheduler runs do.
- Dream simulations should produce snapshots consumable by the soak harness for validation.
- Coordinate with Taskâ€¯002/003 to verify dream-generated patterns respect semantic extraction quality thresholds.
