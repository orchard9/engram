# Task 003: Semantic Memory Extraction

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
3 days

## Dependencies
- Task 002

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 003).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Current Progress
- Consolidation snapshot API exposes semantic belief structures with schema confidence, citation provenance, and freshness metrics.
- Semantic pattern identifiers stabilized for deterministic lookups across REST, SSE, and storage layers.
- Scheduler-backed cache feeds REST/SSE responses, and belief update deltas are persisted to disk for downstream analytics.
- Consolidation service abstraction in place, enabling semantic extraction to run through a consistent interface regardless of backend implementation.
- Soak harness (`consolidation-soak`) provides repeatable datasets for semantic QA and future regression comparisons.
- **NEW (2025-10-19)**: Quality metrics (novelty variance, citation churn) computed per consolidation run:
  - `CONSOLIDATION_NOVELTY_VARIANCE`: Measures diversity of pattern changes (variance of novelty deltas)
  - `CONSOLIDATION_CITATION_CHURN`: Percentage of patterns with citation changes (0-100%)
  - Metrics exposed through consolidation service and streaming aggregator
  - Documented in metrics schema (schema version 1.2.0)
- **NEW (2025-10-19)**: Semantic regression fixtures added to `consolidation_integration_tests.rs`:
  - 6 quality-focused tests validate homogeneous/heterogeneous pattern updates
  - Tests verify novelty variance computation, citation churn tracking, confidence bounds
  - Integration coverage expanded to 16 tests (10 base + 6 quality tests)

## Next Checkpoints
- Partner with Task 006 to wire belief-update logs into operator dashboards and document semantic QA workflows.
- Validate quality metrics in production consolidation runs (check variance/churn thresholds).
- Create visual dashboards for semantic extraction quality monitoring.

## Notes
This task file provides summary information. Complete implementation-ready specifications are in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md.
