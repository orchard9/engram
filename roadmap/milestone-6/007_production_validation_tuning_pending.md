# Task 007: Production Validation Tuning

## Status
PENDING

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
2 days

## Dependencies
- Task 006

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 007).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Notes
- Use the soak harness outputs as baselines for production readiness checks (latency, freshness, novelty).
- Incorporate consolidated dashboards/alerts into the validation checklist before promoting builds.
- Coordinate with Taskâ€¯006 to ensure observability thresholds are enforced during production tuning.
