# Task 001: Consolidation Scheduler

## Status
COMPLETE

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
3 days

## Dependencies
- None

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 001).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Notes
- Background scheduler implemented with asynchronous runs, interruption handling, and consolidated integration tests.
- Consolidation API surfaces now consume scheduler-backed snapshots (see Tasks 002/003 updates).
- Follow-up work tracked under Tasks 002/003/006 for cache reuse, semantic extraction metrics, and observability.
