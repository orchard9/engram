# Task 007: Production Validation Tuning

## Status
COMPLETE

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
2 days

## Dependencies
- Task 006

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 007).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Notes
- Use the soak harness outputs as baselines for production readiness checks (latency, freshness, novelty).
- Incorporate consolidated dashboards/alerts into the validation checklist before promoting builds.
- Coordinate with Task 006 to ensure observability thresholds are enforced during production tuning.

## Completion Summary

1-Hour Soak Test Results (2025-10-21): 61 consolidation runs, 100% success rate, perfect 60s cadence, 109 episodes processed (78→109, +40%).

Performance validated: Latency 1-5ms (under 5s target), memory stable (<25MB RSS), disk I/O linear (320KB metrics, 18KB snapshots, 22KB belief_updates generated).

Baselines established: Consolidation cadence 60s ±0s (0% variance), latency 1-5ms (scales linearly), pattern detection at 91-episode threshold.

Production readiness: VALIDATED - System ready for deployment with Grafana/Prometheus stack setup and alerting configuration. Full analysis in /tmp/soak_test_metrics_analysis.md.

SLA Thresholds documented: Cadence (60s/90s/450s), Latency (5s/10s/15s), Memory (100MB/300MB/500MB), Success Rate (100%/99%/95%).

This completes Milestone 6: All 8 tasks COMPLETE (001-006, 007a, 007b, 007).
