# Task 002: Pattern Detection Engine

## Status
COMPLETE

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
4 days

## Dependencies
- Task 001

## Objective
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete specification.

## Technical Approach
Complete technical specification available in MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md (Milestone 6, Task 002).
Refer to main roadmap document for detailed implementation plan, code examples, integration points, and acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for detailed acceptance criteria.

## Testing Approach
See MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for comprehensive testing strategy.

## Current Progress
- Background consolidation endpoints now surface deterministic semantic pattern IDs and recorded replay stats.
- API documentation covers `/api/v1/consolidations*` with citation trails and temporal provenance, enabling operator validation of schema extraction.
- MemoryStore caches scheduler-generated snapshots, and REST/SSE layers read from the cache with warm-up fallbacks validated by new regression tests.
- Consolidation service boundary introduced (`consolidation::service`), decoupling caching/metrics from `MemoryStore` and enabling future backends.
- `consolidation-soak` harness captures long-form snapshots/metrics for validating pattern detection outputs in situ.

## Next Checkpoints
- Calibrate pattern clustering thresholds using snapshots pulled via `ConsolidationService`; track metrics deltas in soak artifacts (`snapshots.jsonl`).
- Implement service injection hooks so alternate consolidation backends can be introduced without touching pattern extraction code.
- Stress-test cached snapshots under high-ingest workloads (use `consolidation_load_tests.rs` harness once implemented) to confirm scheduler cadence keeps schemas current.
- Document operator playbooks for tuning scheduler cadence and clustering tolerances based on the new observability signals.

## Completion Summary

Successfully implemented pattern detection engine with the following deliverables:

### Core Implementation
- **Pattern Detector** (`engram-core/src/consolidation/pattern_detector.rs`):
  - Hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm
  - Configurable similarity thresholds (default 0.8) and min cluster size (default 3)
  - Pattern strength computation via centroid similarity
  - Temporal sequence detection
  - Deterministic pattern ID generation via hashing
  - Pattern merging for similar clusters (> 0.9 similarity)

- **Statistical Filtering** (`engram-core/src/consolidation/statistical_tests.rs`):
  - Chi-square significance testing (p < 0.01 threshold)
  - Mutual information calculation for feature dependencies
  - Likelihood ratio computation for pattern vs random baseline
  - All filtering methods optimized as static functions

### Testing & Validation
- **Integration Tests** (11 passing tests in `tests/pattern_detection_tests.rs`):
  - End-to-end pattern detection pipeline
  - Min cluster size enforcement
  - Similarity threshold behavior
  - Statistical filtering integration
  - Temporal feature extraction
  - Pattern merging validation
  - Strength computation verification
  - Edge cases (empty episodes, max patterns limit)
  - Pattern ID determinism
  - Custom threshold filtering

- **Benchmarks** (`benches/pattern_detection.rs`):
  - Pattern detection performance across episode counts (10-5000)
  - Clustering algorithm benchmarks
  - Statistical filtering overhead
  - Similarity threshold impact
  - Pattern merging performance
  - End-to-end pipeline benchmarks
  - Large-scale stress tests (1000+ episodes)
  - Performance target: <100ms for 100 episodes, <1s for 1000 episodes

### Code Quality
- Zero clippy warnings (all lints passing)
- All unit and integration tests passing
- Proper error handling and edge case coverage
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Follows project coding guidelines (iterator methods, From conversions, const fn where applicable)
