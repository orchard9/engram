# Task 001: Temporal Dynamics Content Suite

## Objective
Research and author the milestone content package for Milestone 4 (Temporal Dynamics), capturing the cognitive and technical foundations of automatic decay, spaced repetition, and forgetting curve alignment in Engram.

## Priority
P1 (Milestone Narrative)

## Effort Estimate
1.5 days

## Dependencies
- `vision.md`
- `milestones.md` (Milestone 4 objective, critical path, validation)
- Existing milestone content structure (`content/milestone_3/`)

## Deliverables
- `content/milestone_4/001_temporal_dynamics_decay_suite/`
  - `temporal_dynamics_decay_suite_research.md`
  - `temporal_dynamics_decay_suite_perspectives.md`
  - `temporal_dynamics_decay_suite_medium.md`
  - `temporal_dynamics_decay_suite_twitter.md`
- Updated roadmap task status reflecting completion

## Research Focus
- Biological foundations of forgetting curves (Ebbinghaus, Cepeda, Wixted)
- Computational models of memory decay (power-law vs exponential)
- Lazy decay strategies in databases and caches
- Configurable decay functions in large-scale systems
- Validation patterns: benchmarking decay accuracy, valgrind leak detection

## Content Expectations
- Cite primary literature with author/year references inline
- Bridge biological insights with Engram architecture (storage tiers, activation pipeline)
- Highlight testing/validation needed for Milestone 4 acceptance criteria
- Translate technical implications into developer-friendly explanations
- Design Twitter thread with actionable hooks for engineers and researchers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research file summarizes at least five primary sources with citations
- [ ] Perspectives file covers cognitive-architecture, memory-systems, rust-graph-engine, systems-architecture viewpoints
- [ ] Medium article presents cohesive narrative connecting research to Engram implementation plans
- [ ] Twitter thread communicates key insights in 8-10 concise posts with citations where appropriate
- [ ] Content references milestone goals and validation steps from `milestones.md`
- [ ] Task file renamed to `_complete` once deliverables finished

## Testing Approach
- Peer review via documentation lint (manual)
- Spell-check and prose quality via self-review

## Notes
This task does not modify code paths but must maintain repository structure and naming conventions established in earlier milestone content.
