# Task 004: Memory Pool Allocator - Verification Checklist

## Objectives Verification

### 1. Arena allocator - Bump-pointer allocator with fixed capacity
- [x] ArenaAllocator struct implemented in allocator.zig
- [x] Bump-pointer allocation: offset incremented on each allocation
- [x] Fixed capacity: Uses fixed-size backing buffer (1MB for thread-local)
- [x] O(1) allocation performance
- [x] O(1) bulk deallocation via reset()

### 2. Thread-local pools - Per-thread memory pools to avoid contention
- [x] Thread-local storage using `threadlocal` keyword
- [x] 1MB pool per thread (kernel_arena_buffer: [1024 * 1024]u8)
- [x] Lazy initialization on first access
- [x] getThreadArena() returns thread-specific arena instance
- [x] No cross-thread access (each thread has independent pool)

### 3. Zero-copy operation - Caller-provided buffers when possible
- [x] Documentation in ffi.zig shows zero-copy pattern
- [x] Caller allocates output buffers (scores, activations, etc.)
- [x] Arena used only for temporary scratch space
- [x] No hidden allocations in kernel implementations

### 4. Overflow detection - Fail safely when pool exhausted
- [x] alloc() checks if allocation exceeds capacity
- [x] Returns error.OutOfMemory on overflow
- [x] Offset unchanged after failed allocation
- [x] Comprehensive overflow tests in allocator_test.zig

## Deliverables Verification

### Files Created

#### 1. /zig/src/allocator.zig - Memory pool implementation
- [x] ArenaAllocator struct with buffer and offset fields
- [x] init() - Initialize arena with backing buffer
- [x] alloc() - Bump-pointer allocation with alignment
- [x] allocArray() - Typed array allocation
- [x] reset() - Bulk deallocation (offset = 0)
- [x] remaining() - Get available capacity
- [x] utilization() - Track usage fraction
- [x] Thread-local storage: kernel_arena_buffer, kernel_arena, arena_initialized
- [x] getThreadArena() - Get thread-local arena
- [x] resetThreadArena() - Reset thread-local arena
- [x] getThreadArenaUtilization() - Track high-water mark
- [x] Inline unit tests (11 tests covering basic functionality)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation with rationale

#### 2. /zig/src/allocator_test.zig - Allocator unit tests
- [x] Basic allocation tests (zero bytes, single byte, multiple, entire arena)
- [x] Alignment tests (power of two, different types, padding calculation)
- [x] Typed allocation tests (primitives, alignment, read/write)
- [x] Overflow tests (exact capacity, with padding, offset unchanged)
- [x] Reset tests (clears offset, allows reallocation, multiple cycles)
- [x] Remaining capacity tests (decreases with allocations, with padding)
- [x] Utilization tests (tracks fraction, after reset)
- [x] Thread-local arena tests (returns valid, same instance, can allocate, reset, capacity, utilization)
- [x] Stress tests (many small allocations, alternating sizes, mixed alignments)
- [x] Edge cases (zero-size arena, allocation at exact capacity)
- [x] Total: 40 comprehensive unit tests

#### 3. /zig/README.md - Documentation
- [x] Architecture overview
- [x] Build instructions
- [x] Test execution guide
- [x] Integration with Rust explanation
- [x] Performance characteristics
- [x] Design rationale
- [x] Debugging guidance
- [x] Roadmap context

### Files Modified

#### 1. /zig/src/ffi.zig - Integrate allocator with kernels
- [x] Import allocator_mod: const allocator_mod = @import("allocator.zig");
- [x] Documentation showing arena usage pattern with defer
- [x] Example code demonstrating getThreadArena() and resetThreadArena()
- [x] Benefits listed: O(1) alloc/dealloc, zero fragmentation, thread-local, predictable

#### 2. /zig/build.zig - Add allocator tests to build
- [x] allocator_tests test artifact added
- [x] run_allocator_tests step created
- [x] test_step depends on both ffi_tests and allocator_tests

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### 1. Arena allocator passes all unit tests
- [x] 40 comprehensive tests implemented in allocator_test.zig
- [x] Tests cover all core functionality
- [x] Tests include edge cases and stress scenarios
- [ ] Tests pass (requires Zig toolchain installation - documented in README)

### 2. Thread-local pools eliminate allocation contention in benchmarks
- [x] Thread-local storage implemented
- [x] Each thread has independent 1MB arena
- [x] No locks or shared state between threads
- [x] Designed for zero contention
- [ ] Benchmark validation (requires Task 010: Performance Regression Framework)

### 3. Memory leak tests pass (no leaks detected by valgrind)
- [x] Design prevents leaks: fixed-size buffers, no dynamic allocation
- [x] Reset pattern documented in README
- [x] Stress tests in allocator_test.zig verify memory reuse
- [ ] Valgrind integration (requires Rust-side integration in Task 009)

### 4. Overflow detection prevents buffer overruns
- [x] alloc() checks capacity before allocation
- [x] Returns error.OutOfMemory on overflow
- [x] Test coverage: overflow on exact capacity, with alignment padding
- [x] Offset unchanged after failed allocation

### 5. Allocation overhead <1% of kernel runtime
- [x] O(1) allocation: pointer increment + alignment calculation
- [x] O(1) deallocation: offset = 0
- [x] No malloc/free syscalls
- [x] No metadata overhead (0 bytes per allocation)
- [x] Design optimized for hot path
- [ ] Runtime measurement (requires kernel implementations in Tasks 005-007)

## Implementation Quality

### Code Quality
- [x] Follows Zig idioms and standard library patterns
- [x] Comprehensive documentation with examples

### Task 007 (Decay Function Kernel)
- [x] allocator.zig ready for temporary calculation buffers

### Task 008 (Arena Allocator - larger pools)
- [x] Foundation established with ArenaAllocator struct
- [x] Can extend to larger pools or different sizing strategies

## Known Limitations

1. **Zig toolchain not installed**: Tests cannot run until Zig is set up
   - Mitigation: Tests documented in README, ready to run when available
   - Syntax verified through code review

2. **No runtime validation yet**: Acceptance criteria requiring benchmarks/profiling
   - Mitigation: Design follows proven arena allocator patterns
   - Performance characteristics documented and justified

3. **Integration tests pending**: Rust-side integration requires kernel implementations
   - Mitigation: FFI integration pattern documented in ffi.zig
   - Ready for use in Tasks 005-007

## Conclusion

All core requirements met:
- Arena allocator implemented with bump-pointer allocation
- Thread-local pools provide 1MB per thread
- Zero-copy pattern documented
- Overflow detection with safe error handling
- Comprehensive test suite (40 tests)
- Integration points prepared for future tasks

The implementation is complete and ready for:
1. Zig toolchain installation and test execution
2. Integration with kernel implementations (Tasks 005-007)
3. Performance validation (Task 010)
