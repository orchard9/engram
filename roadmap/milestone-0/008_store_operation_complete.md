# Create infallible store() operation with graceful degradation

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement store() operation that never returns errors, instead degrading gracefully under pressure while maintaining system stability. This aligns with cognitive research showing that graceful confidence degradation is more intuitive than binary success/failure patterns.

## Requirements
- Store operation returns activation level, not Result
- Under memory pressure, reduce confidence instead of failing
- Automatic decay of old memories when space needed
- Write-ahead logging for durability without blocking
- Concurrent stores without locking
- Return lower confidence for degraded stores

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] store() has signature: fn store(&self, episode: Episode) -> Activation
- [ ] Never panics regardless of system state
- [ ] Handles OOM by evicting low-activation memories
- [ ] Concurrent stores don't block each other
- [ ] Degraded stores indicated by returned activation level

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Store operations return activation levels instead of Result types to avoid binary thinking patterns
- Graceful degradation under pressure mirrors human memory formation patterns (Reason 1990)
- Formation quality indicators (contextual richness, interference assessment) provide actionable feedback
- Infallible operations reduce defensive programming overhead by 38% (McConnell 2004)

### Implementation Strategy
- Use lock-free data structures for hot tier with cognitive-friendly error reporting
- Consider write buffer with background flushing that doesn't hide formation quality
- Activation level indicates store quality with confidence-based degradation
- May need backpressure mechanism that maintains formation confidence indicators
- Support episodic memory formation patterns with rich contextual encoding (what/when/where/who)

### Research Integration
- Graceful degradation aligns with cognitive research on system reliability (Reason 1990)
- Memory formation operates on continuous confidence gradients, never binary success/failure (Tulving 1972)
- Confidence-based storage quality follows memory systems research foundations
- Human memory formation varies based on attention, contextual richness, and interference levels
- Episodic encoding should include temporal, spatial, and contextual information for biological plausibility
- Formation quality assessment enables system learning and optimization over time
