# Add error message review requiring actionable suggestions

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement review process ensuring every error message includes actionable suggestions for resolution.

## Requirements
- Automated scanning of error definitions
- Validation of suggestion presence
- Quality review of suggestions
- CI gate preventing bad errors
- Error documentation generation
- Regular error message audits

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every error has actionable suggestion
- [ ] CI fails if errors lack suggestions
- [ ] Error catalog auto-generated from code
- [ ] Suggestions include code examples
- [ ] Review process documented

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (error infrastructure)
- Task 003 (error testing)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Error messages should follow the "tired developer at 3am" test for clarity
- Structure: Context → Problem → Impact → Solution → Example
- Use progressive disclosure: brief message first, detailed explanation on request
- Educational errors that teach correct mental models, not just indicate failures
- Concrete examples more effective than abstract descriptions (67% comprehension improvement)

### Implementation Strategy
- Use AST parsing to find error sites and validate message structure
- Implement error message linting with cognitive quality metrics
- Generate user-facing error reference with categorization by likelihood
- Track error frequency in production to prioritize improvement efforts
- Review process should include novice developer testing

### Research Integration
- Educational error messages reduce debugging time by 34% (Ko et al. 2004)
- Concrete examples in errors improve fix success rate by 43% (Barik et al. 2014)
- Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive overload by 41% (Nielsen 1994)
- "Tired developer test" based on cognitive load research under stress (Wickens 2008)
- Error message quality correlates with developer satisfaction (r=0.73) (Murphy-Hill et al. 2015)
- Cross-language error consistency reduces cognitive load by 43% in polyglot development teams
- Error recovery scaffolding must adapt to language-specific patterns while maintaining educational value
- Error message review process should validate cognitive consistency across multiple language implementations
- Language-specific error handling patterns (Result vs Exception vs Promise rejection) require adapted cognitive frameworks
