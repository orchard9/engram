# Initialize Rust workspace with engram-core, engram-storage, engram-cli packages

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
Create the foundational Rust workspace structure with three core packages that will form the basis of the Engram cognitive graph database.

## Requirements
- Create workspace Cargo.toml with workspace members
- Initialize engram-core package for memory types and operations
- Initialize engram-storage package for tiered storage implementation
- Initialize engram-cli package for command-line interface
- Configure shared dependencies at workspace level
- Set up proper version management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workspace compiles with `cargo build`
- [x] All packages properly reference workspace dependencies
- [x] Basic lib.rs or main.rs in each package
- [x] Workspace-level linting and formatting configured

## Dependencies
- None (first task)

## Notes
- Follow structure from core_packages.md
- Use workspace inheritance for common dependencies
- Set rust edition to 2024
