# Build differential testing between implementations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create differential testing framework to ensure Rust and future Zig implementations produce identical results for all operations.

## Requirements
- Test harness comparing implementations
- Automated test case generation
- Bit-identical result verification
- Performance comparison metrics
- Regression test suite from differences
- CI integration for cross-implementation testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework detects any behavioral differences
- [ ] 10K+ operations compared successfully
- [ ] Performance differences documented
- [ ] Automatic bisection of divergences
- [ ] Clear reports of any mismatches

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)

## Notes
- Start with Rust-only, prepare for Zig
- Use quickcheck for test generation
- Consider deterministic mode for debugging
- Save interesting test cases
