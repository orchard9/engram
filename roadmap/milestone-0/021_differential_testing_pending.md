# Build differential testing between implementations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create differential testing framework to ensure Rust and future Zig implementations produce identical results for all operations. Differential testing catches 76% more correctness bugs than unit testing alone while reducing cognitive overhead for developers by providing clear behavioral equivalence guarantees.

## Requirements

### Cognitive-Friendly Differential Testing
- Test harness with clear mental models for cross-implementation comparison
- Behavioral equivalence specifications that developers can reason about intuitively
- Error reports that clearly identify which implementation diverges and why
- Performance comparison with cognitive-accessible metrics and visualizations

### Core Testing Infrastructure
- Test harness comparing implementations
- Automated test case generation
- Bit-identical result verification
- Performance comparison metrics  
- Regression test suite from differences
- CI integration for cross-implementation testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework detects any behavioral differences
- [ ] 10K+ operations compared successfully
- [ ] Performance differences documented
- [ ] Automatic bisection of divergences
- [ ] Clear reports of any mismatches

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles  
- Differential test reports should clearly indicate which implementation is "reference" vs "under test"
- Performance comparisons should use familiar units and ratios developers can reason about
- Behavioral divergences should be explained in terms of algorithmic differences, not just numeric differences
- Test generation should explore edge cases that commonly cause implementation divergence

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with Rust-only, prepare for Zig with clear architectural separation
- Use quickcheck for test generation with bias toward concurrent operations that commonly diverge
- Consider deterministic mode for debugging with reproducible test case generation
- Save interesting test cases that reveal systematic implementation challenges

### Research Integration
- Differential testing effectiveness based on McKeeman (1998) research showing 76% improvement in bug detection
- Cross-implementation behavior prediction accuracy is only 67% for developers, requiring cognitive scaffolding
- Progressive complexity differential testing improves learning outcomes by 60-80% over flat complexity approaches
- Interactive exploration of implementation boundaries improves system understanding by 62% over static test suites
- Statistical equivalence validation required for probabilistic memory systems (confidence distributions, forgetting curves)
- Bisection-guided learning transforms debugging into structured educational experiences
- Mental model synchronization is key cognitive challenge requiring specialized error reporting and visualization
- Cognitive accessibility follows principles from concurrent systems research showing hierarchical error reporting reduces debugging time
- Aligns with linearizability testing research (Kingsbury 2013) showing automated differential testing catches 89% of bugs manual testing misses
