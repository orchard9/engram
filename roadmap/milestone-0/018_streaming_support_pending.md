# Add streaming support for continuous memory operations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement streaming interfaces for both gRPC and HTTP to support continuous memory formation and real-time recall operations.

## Requirements
- Bidirectional gRPC streaming for continuous store/recall
- Server-sent events (SSE) for HTTP streaming
- Backpressure handling for flow control
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Buffering for temporarily offline clients
- Stream multiplexing for efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] gRPC streams handle 1K messages/sec
- [ ] SSE provides real-time updates to browsers
- [ ] Graceful degradation on connection issues
- [ ] Memory-bounded buffering
- [ ] Clear stream lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- Task 016 (gRPC service)
- Task 017 (HTTP API)

## Notes
- Use tokio streams
- Consider WebSocket as alternative to SSE
- Implement heartbeat/keepalive
- Support stream resumption
