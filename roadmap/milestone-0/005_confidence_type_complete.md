# Implement Cognitive Confidence Type with Human-Centered Design

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
Create a Confidence newtype that aligns with human cognitive architecture for probabilistic reasoning. Enforces [0,1] range mathematically while providing cognitive ergonomics that prevent systematic biases and support natural mental models. No Option<f32> allowed for confidence values.

## Requirements

### Core Mathematical Properties
- Newtype wrapper Confidence(f32) with private constructor
- Validation ensuring values always in [0,1] range
- Zero-cost abstraction (compiles to raw f32 in release)
- Serde support with validation on deserialization
- No Option<Confidence> in public APIs

### Cognitive Architecture Features
- Frequency-based constructors matching human intuition
- Qualitative categories (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) for natural reasoning
- Logical operations (and/or) that prevent cognitive biases
- System 1-friendly operations that feel automatic
- Built-in overconfidence correction mechanisms
- Base rate integration where applicable

### Bias Prevention Systems
- Conjunction fallacy prevention in combination operations
- Overconfidence calibration against historical data
- Base rate neglect prevention through explicit priors
- Clear mental model alignment with domain concepts

## Acceptance Criteria

### Mathematical Correctness
- [ ] Cannot construct Confidence with value outside [0,1]
- [ ] All operations maintain range invariants automatically
- [ ] Zero-cost abstraction (no runtime overhead in release)
- [ ] Compile-time prevention of Option<f32> for confidence

### Cognitive Ergonomics
- [ ] Frequency constructors: `from_successes(3, 10)` feel natural
- [ ] Qualitative categories: `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW` constants available
- [ ] System 1 operations: `is_high()`, `seems_legitimate()` feel automatic
- [ ] Logical combinations: `belief_a.and(belief_b)` match natural thinking

### Bias Prevention
- [ ] Conjunction fallacy: `a.and(b)` always â‰¤ min(a, b)
- [ ] Overconfidence correction: calibration mechanisms available
- [ ] Base rate integration: priors explicit in relevant operations
- [ ] Natural language patterns: operations match developer mental models

### Performance & Integration
- [ ] Compiles to optimal f32 operations in release builds
- [ ] SIMD compatibility for batch confidence operations
- [ ] Thread-safe for concurrent confidence updates
- [ ] Clear error messages that build procedural knowledge

## Dependencies
- Task 001 (workspace setup)

## Notes

### Implementation Strategy
- Use const fn for compile-time validation where possible
- Leverage debug_assert! for development-time cognitive checks
- Implement From traits for natural conversion patterns
- Design API to match frequency-based human reasoning

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Frequency interface: humans understand "3 out of 10" better than "0.3"
- Qualitative categories: match natural language confidence expressions
- Logical operations: align with how people combine beliefs naturally
- Bias prevention: build systematic error prevention into type system
- Procedural knowledge: consistent patterns that become automatic skills

### Research Foundation
- Based on Gigerenzer & Hoffrage (1995) frequency format research showing dramatic improvement in probabilistic reasoning with frequency formats
- Incorporates Kahneman & Tversky cognitive bias prevention (conjunction fallacy, overconfidence bias)
- Aligns with dual-process theory (System 1 vs System 2 thinking) from Kahneman (2011)
- Supports procedural memory formation through consistent API patterns (Logan 1988 automaticity research)
- Implements processing fluency principles (Reber et al. 2004) for cognitive ergonomics
- Follows working memory constraints (Baddeley & Hitch 1974) to prevent cognitive overload
- See content/0_developer_experience_foundation/005_memory_systems_cognitive_confidence_research.md for comprehensive scientific basis

### Memory System Integration
- Confidence values should reflect retrieval reliability following recognition vs recall patterns (Mandler 1980)
- Decay patterns should follow Ebbinghaus forgetting curves for psychological realism
- Spreading activation confidence propagation should match neural network activation patterns
- Context-dependent confidence adjustments following Godden & Badeley (1975) research
