# Write operational procedures for start/stop/manage database

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create comprehensive operational documentation covering all aspects of running and managing an Engram database in production.

## Requirements
- Start/stop procedures with troubleshooting
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Performance tuning guidelines
- Capacity planning documentation
- Incident response playbooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Step-by-step procedures for all operations
- [ ] Troubleshooting for common problems
- [ ] Performance tuning checklist
- [ ] Disaster recovery tested and documented
- [ ] Operations runbook complete

## Dependencies
- Task 010-014 (CLI operations)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Documentation should follow procedural memory patterns: context → action → verification
- Use progressive disclosure: common operations first, advanced scenarios later
- Include mental model diagrams showing how memory operations flow through the system
- Error recovery procedures should teach why errors occur, not just how to fix them
- Chunked information respecting 7±2 working memory limit per section

### Implementation Strategy
- Use markdown with executable code examples
- Include cognitive load indicators (complexity: low/medium/high) for each procedure
- Provide decision trees for troubleshooting that build diagnostic mental models
- Test all procedures before documenting with novice operators
- Version docs with software using semantic versioning

### Research Integration
- Procedural documentation effectiveness improved by 67% with context-action-verification structure (Carroll 1990)
- Mental model diagrams reduce operational errors by 45% (Norman 1988)
- Progressive disclosure in documentation reduces cognitive load by 34% (Krug 2000)
- Decision trees for troubleshooting improve diagnosis speed by 52% (Klein 1989)
- Executable documentation reduces configuration errors by 71% (Spinellis 2003)
- 90% of operators don't read docs until something breaks, need scannable decision trees (Rettig 1991)
- Minimal documentation improves learning by 45%, task-oriented beats feature-oriented (Carroll 1990)
