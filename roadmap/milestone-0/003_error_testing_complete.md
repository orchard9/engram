# Implement cognitive load and memory-systems error testing

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create comprehensive testing framework that validates error messages build procedural knowledge and work under cognitive load. Tests should ensure errors pass the "3am tired developer test" by supporting System 1 thinking when System 2 is degraded.

## Requirements

### Memory-Systems Testing
- **Pattern Consistency Validation**: Test that similar error families follow identical cognitive patterns to enable memory consolidation
- **Procedural Knowledge Transfer**: Validate that error experiences build reusable problem-solving procedures
- **Memory Persistence Simulation**: Test that developers get faster at resolving similar errors over time
- **Contextual Robustness**: Ensure error messages work across different contexts without requiring prior experience

### Cognitive Load Testing  
- **Information Chunk Validation**: Errors must fit within reduced working memory capacity (≤3 chunks when fatigued)
- **Pattern Recognition Support**: Test that errors are recognizable by System 1 thinking without analytical processing
- **Visual Hierarchy Testing**: Ensure important information isn't lost under reduced selective attention

### Infrastructure
- Build test harness validating every error has context/suggestion/example
- Property-based testing for error scenario generation
- Automated review process for cognitive requirements
- Performance testing (error formatting <1ms, comprehension <30sec)
- CI integration preventing merge of cognitively unclear errors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Pattern Consistency**: All errors in same family use identical cognitive structure
- [ ] **Procedural Validation**: Every error's suggested procedure is executable and solves the problem
- [ ] **Memory Building**: Test that repeated similar errors show improved resolution time
- [ ] **Cognitive Load**: Errors work with ≤3 information chunks and System 1 processing
- [ ] **Transfer Learning**: Procedures learned from one error apply to similar error types  
- [ ] **Context Independence**: Errors work without remembering previous encounters
- [ ] **Performance Gates**: Error formatting <1ms, comprehension testing <30sec
- [ ] **Quality Infrastructure**: Automated testing catches all cognitive requirements
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Builds fail if errors don't meet memory-systems criteria
- [ ] **Developer Experience Metrics**: Track time-to-comprehension and success rates

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Testing Infrastructure
```rust
pub struct CognitiveErrorTesting {
    pattern_registry: HashMap<ErrorFamily, CognitivePattern>,
    memory_simulator: ProcedualLearningSimulator, 
    cognitive_load_tester: CognitiveLoadTester,
    performance_monitor: ErrorPerformanceMonitor,
}
```

### Test Categories
1. **Pattern Consistency Tests**: Validate error families follow identical structures
2. **Procedural Knowledge Tests**: Ensure suggestions are executable and generalizable  
3. **Memory Persistence Tests**: Simulate learning curves over repeated exposures
4. **Cognitive Load Tests**: Validate errors work under System 1 processing
5. **Performance Tests**: Ensure error formatting meets <1ms requirement

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (error infrastructure with CognitiveError type)

## Notes
- Implements memory-systems research from content/002_testing_developer_fatigue_states
- Focus on procedural memory building over declarative information
- Property-based testing for comprehensive error scenario coverage
- May need initial manual baseline for expected learning curves
- Consider A/B testing framework for measuring error message effectiveness
