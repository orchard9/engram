# Create type-state compile-time validation tests

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Build comprehensive test suite validating that type-state patterns prevent invalid memory construction at compile time.

## Requirements
- Compile-fail tests for invalid constructions
- Positive tests for valid constructions
- Documentation of type-state patterns
- Examples of correct usage
- CI verification of compile-time safety
- Benchmark ensuring zero runtime cost

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Invalid Memory construction fails compilation
- [ ] Clear compiler errors guide to solution
- [ ] All valid patterns compile successfully
- [ ] Zero runtime overhead verified
- [ ] Examples cover common use cases

## Dependencies
- Task 007 (typestate pattern)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Compile-fail tests should teach correct usage patterns through clear error messages
- Test progression should match learning complexity (simple → intermediate → advanced constructions)
- Examples should demonstrate cognitive-friendly typestate patterns that guide discovery
- Error messages should explain why certain constructions are invalid in terms of memory system concepts

### Implementation Strategy
- Use trybuild for compile-fail tests with educational error message validation
- Document the pattern for other developers with progressive complexity examples
- Ensure good compiler error messages that teach rather than just indicate failures
- Consider macro to reduce boilerplate while maintaining type-guided learning
- Test both positive (correct) and negative (should-fail) patterns to build complete mental models

### Research Integration
- Type-guided API discovery reduces cognitive load by providing compiler-driven learning
- Progressive type complexity matches human learning patterns (60-80% better outcomes vs flat complexity)
- Phantom types and builder patterns serve as cognitive scaffolding for correct usage
- Compiler errors as teaching opportunities improve long-term developer competence by 34% (Ko et al. 2004)
- Type-state patterns make impossible states unrepresentable, eliminating entire classes of runtime errors
- Compile-time property validation provides stronger guarantees than runtime property testing
- Educational compiler errors reduce debugging time and improve mental model formation
- Type safety adaptation crucial for multi-language cognitive consistency - compile-time safety in Rust translates to runtime validation in dynamic languages
- Typestate patterns provide mental model templates that can be adapted across programming paradigms
- Cross-language type safety strategies enable cognitive consistency while leveraging language-specific strengths
