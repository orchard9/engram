# Implement error message testing with "3am developer" clarity criterion

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create comprehensive testing framework that validates every error message passes the "Would a tired developer at 3am understand what to do?" test.

## Requirements
- Build test harness validating every error has context/suggestion/example
- Create corpus of error scenarios with expected messages
- Automated review process for error readability
- Regression testing for error message quality
- Human-readable error catalog generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test suite that catches errors missing any required component
- [ ] Every error in codebase has corresponding test
- [ ] CI integration preventing merge of unclear errors
- [ ] Error message style guide documented
- [ ] Automated generation of error reference documentation

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (error infrastructure)

## Notes
- Consider property-based testing for error scenarios
- May need manual review process initially
- Create "bad example" / "good example" comparisons
