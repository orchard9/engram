# Create infallible recall() operation returning (Episode, Confidence) tuples

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
Implement recall() operation that always returns results with confidence scores, never failing even when no exact matches exist. This prevents the Option<Confidence> anti-pattern identified in cognitive research and provides graceful uncertainty handling.

## Requirements
- Recall returns Vec<(Episode, Confidence)>, never Result
- Empty results distinguished from low-confidence results
- Partial pattern matching with confidence degradation
- Spreading activation for associative recall
- Concurrent recalls without blocking
- Reconstruction of missing details with low confidence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] recall() signature: fn recall(&self, cue: Cue) -> Vec<(Episode, Confidence)>
- [ ] Always returns, even if empty vector
- [ ] Confidence scores properly normalized [0,1]
- [ ] Supports multiple cue types (embedding, context, temporal)
- [ ] Non-blocking concurrent execution

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)
- Task 008 (store operation)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Recall operations return Vec<(Episode, Confidence)> instead of Result types for infallible operation patterns
- Support three types of memory retrieval: vivid memories, vague recollections, reconstructed details
- Empty results distinguished from low-confidence results to avoid binary thinking
- Memory reconstruction should be explicit and transparent with confidence indicators
- Spreading activation should follow familiar neural network mental models

### Implementation Strategy  
- Use activation spreading from vision.md with cognitive-friendly parameter naming
- Consider async for long-running recalls without hiding confidence assessment
- Empty vec != error condition - always provide retrieval quality assessment
- Implement basic similarity first, spreading activation later with confidence propagation
- Support multiple cue types (embedding, temporal, contextual) for comprehensive retrieval
- Enable associative discovery through spreading activation patterns

### Research Integration
- Recognition vs recall confidence patterns should follow Mandler (1980) research
- Memory retrieval is reconstructive, not reproductive (Bartlett 1932) 
- Spreading activation confidence propagation aligns with neural network activation patterns
- Multiple cue types support context-dependent memory retrieval (Godden & Baddeley 1975)
- Human memory operates on confidence gradients with graceful degradation under pressure
- Associative retrieval through spreading activation enables discovery beyond explicit queries
- Reconstruction from schemas should indicate sources and confidence levels transparently
