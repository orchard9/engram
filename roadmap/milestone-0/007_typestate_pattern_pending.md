# Build type-state pattern preventing invalid memory construction

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement type-state pattern that makes it impossible to construct invalid memories at compile time, using Rust's type system to enforce correctness.

## Requirements
- Type-state builder for Memory construction
- Compile-time enforcement of required fields
- Phantom types to track builder state
- Impossible to call build() without all required fields
- Graceful degradation for optional fields
- Zero runtime cost (all checks at compile time)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cannot compile code that creates Memory without embedding
- [ ] Cannot compile code that creates Episode without timestamp
- [ ] Builder pattern guides through required steps
- [ ] Optional fields have sensible defaults
- [ ] No runtime validation needed for construction

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)

## Notes
- Use phantom data and zero-sized types
- Consider session types for complex workflows
- Look at typed-builder crate for inspiration
- Ensure good compiler error messages
