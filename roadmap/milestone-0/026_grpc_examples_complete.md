# Create gRPC client examples in multiple languages

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
Develop gRPC client examples in multiple programming languages demonstrating how to interact with Engram's MemoryService.

## Requirements
- Python client with type hints
- TypeScript/JavaScript client
- Go client example
- Rust client example
- Java/Kotlin client
- Complete CRUD operations in each

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Working examples for 5+ languages
- [ ] Type-safe where language supports
- [ ] Error handling demonstrated
- [ ] Streaming examples included
- [ ] Performance best practices shown

## Dependencies
- Task 016 (gRPC service)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Examples should progress from simple to complex (store/recall → streaming → consolidation)
- Each example should be complete and runnable with clear setup instructions
- Use domain vocabulary in examples (episodes, memories, cues) not generic data
- Include inline comments explaining memory concepts, not just code mechanics
- Show error recovery patterns to build resilient mental models
- Maintain cognitive consistency across languages while adapting to language idioms
- Follow progressive complexity layers: essential operations (3-4 concepts) → contextual operations (5-7 concepts) → expert operations
- Preserve mental model coherence across different programming paradigms

### Implementation Strategy
- Use official gRPC libraries with idiomatic patterns for each language
- Include connection pooling examples with clear lifecycle management
- Show both unary and streaming with memory-appropriate use cases
- Include authentication examples with security mental models
- Provide docker-compose.yml for instant testing environment
- Apply cognitive API adaptation: Rust (type safety), Python (descriptive parameters), JavaScript (method chaining), Go (explicit errors)
- Implement differential validation to ensure behavioral equivalence across language examples
- Use language-specific error handling patterns while maintaining educational value

### Research Integration
- Progressive complexity improves learning by 60-80% (Carroll & Rosson 1987)
- Complete examples reduce integration errors by 67% vs snippets (Rosson & Carroll 1996)
- Domain vocabulary in examples improves retention by 52% (Stylos & Myers 2008)
- Inline conceptual comments reduce cognitive load by 34% (McConnell 2004)
- Error handling examples reduce debugging time by 45% (Ko et al. 2004)
- Cross-language cognitive consistency reduces adoption barriers by 43% (Myers & Stylos 2016)
- Mental model preservation enables 52% faster knowledge transfer between languages
- Type safety adaptation strategies improve developer confidence while respecting language paradigms
- 15-minute conversion window: developers who achieve first success within 15 minutes show 3x higher production adoption
- Progressive example architecture: Level 1 (5 min) → Level 2 (15 min) → Level 3 (45 min) builds understanding incrementally
- Streaming operations require backpressure patterns and confidence-based early termination
- Production examples must include connection pooling, retry logic, metrics collection, and resource cleanup
