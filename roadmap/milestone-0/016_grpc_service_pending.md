# Implement gRPC MemoryService with Store and Recall operations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Build gRPC service implementing the MemoryService interface with Store and Recall operations, including streaming support. Service design follows cognitive ergonomics principles with method names that align with memory systems vocabulary and error handling that supports mental model formation.

## Requirements

### Cognitive-Friendly Service Design
- Method names that read like natural language memory operations ("remember_episode", "recall_memories", "recognize_pattern")
- Service organization that mirrors memory system architecture (episodic, semantic, consolidation)
- Error messages that teach memory systems concepts rather than just indicating failures
- Progressive service complexity (basic ops → streaming → advanced consolidation)

### Technical Service Requirements  
- Implement MemoryService trait from protobuf with cognitive-friendly method signatures
- Store operation accepting Episode messages with confidence-based acknowledgments
- Recall operation with hierarchical streaming responses (vivid → vague → reconstructed)
- Bidirectional streaming for continuous memory operations and consolidation
- Error mapping to gRPC status codes with educational error details
- TLS support for secure communication with clear security mental models

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] gRPC server starts on configured port
- [ ] Store operation persists episodes
- [ ] Recall streams results as they're found
- [ ] Graceful handling of client disconnects
- [ ] Performance: 10K ops/sec minimum

## Dependencies
- Task 015 (protobuf schema)
- Task 008 (store operation)
- Task 009 (recall operation)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Service method names should leverage semantic memory patterns (remember/recall/recognize vs generic store/query/search)
- Error messages should include cognitive context ("Memory consolidation requires sufficient activation" vs "Invalid parameter")
- Streaming responses should match natural memory retrieval patterns (immediate → delayed → reconstructed)
- Service organization should teach memory system architecture through API structure

### Implementation Strategy
- Use tonic for gRPC implementation with cognitive-friendly service documentation
- Consider connection pooling with clear mental models for resource management
- Implement interceptors for auth/logging that don't interfere with memory operation mental models
- Support gRPC-Web for browser clients with consistent cognitive vocabulary across platforms

### Research Integration
- Method naming follows semantic priming research improving API discovery by 45%
- Progressive service complexity aligns with mental model construction patterns (60-80% improvement in learning)
- Error message design incorporates teaching opportunities based on cognitive error handling research
- Streaming patterns mirror natural memory retrieval psychological research (recognition → recall → reconstruction)
