# Create property-based fuzzing for confidence operations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement comprehensive fuzzing harness to verify confidence operations never panic and always maintain valid probability ranges.

## Requirements
- Property-based tests for all confidence operations
- Fuzzing harness for random input generation
- Verification of range invariants [0,1]
- Testing confidence propagation through operations
- Coverage-guided fuzzing
- Continuous fuzzing in CI

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 100% branch coverage of confidence code
- [ ] 1M+ iterations without panic
- [ ] All outputs validated within [0,1]
- [ ] Arithmetic operations preserve invariants
- [ ] CI runs fuzzing on every commit

## Dependencies
- Task 005 (Confidence type)

## Notes
- Use proptest for property testing
- Consider cargo-fuzz for fuzzing
- Use arbitrary for input generation
- Track and minimize failure cases
