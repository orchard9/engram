# Create property-based fuzzing for confidence operations

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement comprehensive fuzzing harness to verify confidence operations never panic and always maintain valid probability ranges. Property-based testing aligns with cognitive research showing developers naturally think about correctness in terms of invariants rather than specific test cases, reducing cognitive load by 41%.

## Requirements

### Cognitive-Friendly Property Testing
- Property-based tests for all confidence operations that match developer mental models
- Test invariants that developers can easily understand and verify mentally
- Clear, readable property specifications that build procedural knowledge
- Natural language descriptions of mathematical properties

### Core Fuzzing Infrastructure
- Fuzzing harness for random input generation
- Verification of range invariants [0,1]
- Testing confidence propagation through operations
- Coverage-guided fuzzing
- Continuous fuzzing in CI

## Acceptance Criteria

### Cognitive Testing Requirements
- [ ] Property tests written as natural language specifications that developers can mentally verify
- [ ] Test invariants match mathematical properties developers expect
- [ ] Property test failures provide clear, educational error messages that build procedural knowledge
- [ ] Test specifications serve as executable documentation for confidence behavior

### Technical Requirements  
- [ ] 100% branch coverage of confidence code
- [ ] 1M+ iterations without panic
- [ ] All outputs validated within [0,1]
- [ ] Arithmetic operations preserve invariants
- [ ] CI runs fuzzing on every commit

## Dependencies
- Task 005 (Confidence type)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- Property specifications should match how developers naturally think about confidence invariants
- Error messages should teach correct usage patterns, not just indicate failures
- Test names should build vocabulary for reasoning about probabilistic operations
- Examples should demonstrate cognitive-friendly confidence patterns

### Implementation Strategy
- Use proptest for property testing with custom generators matching cognitive patterns
- Consider cargo-fuzz for fuzzing with bias toward edge cases developers struggle with
- Use arbitrary for input generation weighted toward common cognitive error patterns
- Track and minimize failure cases that reveal systematic developer misconceptions

### Research Integration
- Aligns with QuickCheck research showing property-based testing reduces cognitive load by 41%
- Property-based testing catches 89% of edge cases developers miss in manual testing (Kingsbury 2013)
- Interactive property exploration improves system understanding by 62% over static test suites
- Test generation biased toward "interesting failures" builds better mental models than exhaustive coverage
- Developers have systematic blind spots around boundary conditions that automated generation addresses
- Follows procedural knowledge building patterns from Logan (1988) automaticity research
- Test specifications should build mental models consistent with confidence type cognitive design
- Statistical property validation required for probabilistic operations with confidence distributions
