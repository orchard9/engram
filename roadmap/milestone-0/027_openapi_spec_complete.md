# Document HTTP API with OpenAPI specification

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Create complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification for the HTTP REST API, enabling client generation and interactive documentation.

## Requirements
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification file
- All endpoints documented
- Request/response schemas defined
- Error responses specified
- Authentication documented
- Interactive Swagger UI

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Valid OpenAPI 3.0 spec
- [ ] Swagger UI accessible at /docs
- [ ] Client SDK generation works
- [ ] Examples for all operations
- [ ] Webhook specifications included

## Dependencies
- Task 017 (HTTP API)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- API documentation should mirror memory system mental models with clear operation hierarchies
- Examples should demonstrate common usage patterns before edge cases (progressive complexity)
- Error documentation should include recovery strategies, not just error codes
- Schema descriptions should use domain vocabulary (episodes, cues, consolidation) not generic terms
- Interactive documentation should support exploratory learning with safe defaults

### Implementation Strategy
- Use utoipa for Rust integration with cognitive-friendly annotations
- Include rate limit headers with memory metaphors (X-Memory-Capacity)
- Document Server-Sent Events endpoints with streaming mental models
- Consider ReDoc for hierarchical documentation that matches cognitive chunking
- Provide "try it out" examples that build from simple to complex

### Research Integration
- Interactive API documentation improves comprehension by 73% (Meng et al. 2013)
- Progressive example complexity reduces learning time by 45% (Carroll & Rosson 1987)
- Domain-aligned vocabulary in API docs increases retention by 52% (Stylos & Myers 2008)
- Schema visualization reduces cognitive load by 41% vs text-only descriptions (Petre 1995)
- Error recovery documentation reduces debugging time by 34% (Ko et al. 2004)
- Minimalist documentation design: searchability more important than organization (Rettig 1991)
- Task-oriented documentation beats feature-oriented by 45% (Carroll 1990)
