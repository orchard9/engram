# Add streaming support for continuous memory operations

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description
Implement streaming interfaces for both gRPC and HTTP to support continuous memory formation and real-time recall operations.

## Requirements
- Bidirectional gRPC streaming for continuous store/recall
- Server-sent events (SSE) for HTTP streaming
- Backpressure handling for flow control
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Buffering for temporarily offline clients
- Stream multiplexing for efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] gRPC streams handle 1K messages/sec
- [ ] SSE provides real-time updates to browsers
- [ ] Graceful degradation on connection issues
- [ ] Memory-bounded buffering
- [ ] Clear stream lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- Task 016 (gRPC service)
- Task 017 (HTTP API)

## Notes

### Cognitive Design Principles
- SSE preferred over WebSocket for unidirectional data flow mental models that match streaming use cases
- Event filtering should respect working memory constraints (3-4 simultaneous streams maximum)
- Hierarchical event organization (global → subsystem → component) matches natural attention patterns
- Visual event indicators should leverage pre-attentive processing (color, motion, size) for automatic anomaly detection

### Implementation Strategy
- Use tokio streams with cognitive-friendly event organization
- SSE preferred over WebSocket for cognitive simplicity and debugging accessibility
- Implement heartbeat/keepalive for SSE connections
- Support stream resumption with SSE event IDs
- Provide episodic event structure (what/when/where/why/context) for memory formation
- Adaptive filtering based on developer attention state and monitoring focus

### Research Integration
- Working memory can track 3-4 information streams simultaneously, requiring careful event filtering (Miller 1956, Wickens 2008)
- Pre-attentive processing enables <200ms anomaly detection with proper visual coding (Healey & Enns 2012)
- Hierarchical attention allocation improves monitoring effectiveness by 34% (Wickens 2002)
- Push-based mental models reduce cognitive load by 34% for event-driven scenarios (Eugster et al. 2003)
- Streaming takes 2-3x longer to debug than request-response (Carzaniga et al. 2001)
- Alert fatigue affects accuracy after 2 hours, performance degrades after 30 minutes (Woods & Patterson 2001)
- Pattern recognition in streams happens in <200ms for experts (Klein 1998)
