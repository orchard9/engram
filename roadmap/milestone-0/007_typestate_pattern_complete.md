# Build type-state pattern preventing invalid memory construction

## Status: PENDING

## Description
Implement type-state pattern that makes it impossible to construct invalid memories at compile time, using Rust's type system to enforce correctness. This aligns with cognitive research showing that preventing systematic errors at compile time reduces cognitive load and builds better procedural knowledge.

## Requirements

### Core Type-State Implementation
- Type-state builder for Memory construction with cognitive confidence integration
- Compile-time enforcement of required fields (prevents systematic construction errors)
- Phantom types to track builder state transitions
- Impossible to call build() without all required fields
- Graceful degradation for optional fields with cognitive defaults
- Zero runtime cost (all checks at compile time)

### Cognitive Architecture Integration
- Builder patterns that match natural construction mental models
- Confidence integration that feels automatic (never Option<Confidence>)
- Compiler error messages that build procedural knowledge
- State transitions that match developer expectations about memory creation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Compile-Time Safety
- [ ] Cannot compile code that creates Memory without embedding
- [ ] Cannot compile code that creates Episode without timestamp
- [ ] Cannot compile code that creates memory types without confidence
- [ ] Builder pattern guides through required steps intuitively
- [ ] Optional fields have cognitively sensible defaults
- [ ] No runtime validation needed for construction

### Cognitive Ergonomics
- [ ] Builder state transitions feel natural to developers
- [ ] Compiler error messages teach correct construction patterns
- [ ] Confidence integration works seamlessly with typestate pattern
- [ ] Construction patterns build procedural knowledge through repetition

## Dependencies
- Task 006 (Memory types)

## Notes

### Implementation Strategy
- Use phantom data and zero-sized types for state tracking
- Consider session types for complex memory construction workflows
- Look at typed-builder crate for inspiration and patterns
- Ensure compiler error messages build procedural knowledge

### Cognitive Design Principles
- State transitions should match mental models of memory creation
- Required fields should be obvious and prevent common developer mistakes
- Confidence integration should feel automatic, never optional
- Error messages should teach correct patterns, not just indicate failures

### Research Alignment
- Prevents systematic construction errors identified in cognitive research (Green & Petre 1996 cognitive dimensions)
- Reduces cognitive load by moving validation to compile time following Sweller (2011) cognitive load theory
- Builds procedural knowledge through consistent construction patterns (Logan 1988 automaticity research)
- Aligns with dual-process theory by making correct construction feel automatic (Kahneman 2011 System 1 vs System 2)
- Supports working memory constraints by chunking complex operations (Baddeley & Hitch 1974)
- Error messages should build procedural knowledge following Becker et al. (2019) programmer error research
- Processing fluency principles (Reber et al. 2004) should guide compiler error message design
