# Task 004: Confidence Calibration Framework

## Status
COMPLETE ✅

## Priority
P0 (Critical Path)

## Effort Estimate
2 days (Actual: 1 day)

## Dependencies
- Task 003: Uncertainty Tracking System

## Objective
Implement empirical calibration framework that tracks predicted confidence vs actual correctness
to ensure confidence scores are well-calibrated (<5% ECE, >0.9 correlation with accuracy).

## Technical Approach
Implemented comprehensive calibration framework with:
- Bin-based tracking (10 bins from 0.0-1.0)
- Calibration metrics: ECE (Expected Calibration Error), MCE (Maximum Calibration Error), Brier score
- Spearman rank correlation computation
- Empirical adjustment based on observed calibration
- Caching with circular buffer (100k sample limit)

### Key Files
- ✅ Created: `engram-core/src/query/confidence_calibration.rs` (829 lines)
- ✅ Created: `engram-core/tests/confidence_calibration_tests.rs` (19 integration tests)
- ✅ Modified: `engram-core/src/query/mod.rs` (added module export)

### Implementation Details
- `CalibrationBin`: Tracks samples in confidence range with average confidence, accuracy, and calibration error
- `CalibrationTracker`: Main tracker with 10 bins, sample recording, and metrics computation
- `CalibrationMetrics`: ECE, MCE, Brier score, correlation, and per-bin statistics
- `CalibrationSample`: Single prediction/outcome pair
- `BinStatistic`: Detailed statistics for calibration report
- Spearman correlation computed using rank-based approach
- Calibration adjustment with ±50% clamping to prevent extreme corrections

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Bin-based tracking with configurable number of bins (default 10)
- [x] Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation with weighted averaging
- [x] Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) tracking
- [x] Brier score computation for prediction accuracy
- [x] Spearman rank correlation between confidence and accuracy
- [x] Empirical calibration adjustment (get_adjustment_factor, apply_calibration)
- [x] Target validation methods (meets_target for <5% ECE, has_high_correlation for >0.9)
- [x] Circular buffer for bounded memory usage (100k samples max)
- [x] Zero clippy warnings in calibration module
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests (16 tests)
- [x] Integration tests covering realistic scenarios (19 tests)

## Testing Approach
Created comprehensive test suite:
- ✅ `engram-core/tests/confidence_calibration_tests.rs` - 19 integration tests
- ✅ Unit tests in `confidence_calibration.rs` - 16 tests

### Test Coverage
- Perfect calibration scenarios (ECE validation)
- Systematic overconfidence detection
- Brier score for perfect and worst predictions
- Calibration adjustment (reduce overconfidence, increase underconfidence)
- Bin statistics and detailed breakdown
- Empty tracker edge cases
- Correlation computation (high correlation, low correlation)
- Realistic query calibration scenarios
- Edge cases (all correct, all wrong, mixed bin occupancy)

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
1. **confidence_calibration.rs** (829 lines)
   - CalibrationBin with sample aggregation
   - CalibrationTracker with metric computation
   - CalibrationMetrics with ECE, MCE, Brier, correlation
   - Spearman rank correlation implementation
   - Calibration adjustment with empirical corrections
   - 16 comprehensive unit tests

2. **confidence_calibration_tests.rs** (19 integration tests)
   - Perfect calibration validation
   - Overconfidence/underconfidence detection
   - Calibration adjustment scenarios
   - Correlation computation validation
   - Realistic query calibration scenarios

### Performance Characteristics
- Bin lookup: O(log n) with BTreeMap (n = number of bins, typically 10)
- Metric computation: O(n) for bins + O(n log n) for correlation
- Memory usage: Bounded to max_samples (default 100k samples)
- ECE computation: Weighted average across bins
- Spearman correlation: O(n log n) sorting-based approach

### Quality Checks
- ✅ All 35 tests pass (16 unit + 19 integration)
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings in calibration module
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Property verification (calibration error bounds, correlation validity)

### Integration Points
- Extends confidence framework from engram-core::Confidence
- Compatible with ProbabilisticQueryResult from query/mod.rs
- Ready for integration with query executor (Task 001)
- Follows same pattern as uncertainty_tracker (Task 003)
- Can be used for monitoring and validation in production

## Notes
Implementation provides mathematically sound calibration tracking with:
- ECE formula: Weighted average of |avg_confidence - accuracy| across bins
- Brier score: Mean squared error between predictions and binary outcomes
- Spearman correlation: Rank-based correlation to detect monotonic relationship
- Adjustment factor: (actual_accuracy / predicted_confidence) clamped to [0.5, 1.5]

The framework enables confidence score validation and empirical correction to ensure
"70% confident" actually means correct ~70% of the time.
