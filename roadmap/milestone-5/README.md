# Milestone 5: Probabilistic Query Foundation - Implementation Overview

## Executive Summary

Milestone 5 establishes production query executor returning `Vec<(Episode, Confidence)>` tuples with mathematically sound uncertainty propagation, formal verification, and empirical calibration.

## Critical Path Analysis

**Total Duration:** 14 days
**Parallel Track Utilization:** Single critical path (sequential dependencies)

### Phase Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Core Foundation (Days 1-3)** - Task 001: Query Executor Core
- **Phase 2: Evidence & Uncertainty (Days 4-7)** - Tasks 002-003
- **Phase 3: Calibration & Verification (Days 8-11)** - Tasks 004-005
- **Phase 4: Operations & Validation (Days 12-14)** - Tasks 006-007

## Task Dependencies

004 (Calibration) ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
                                                   ↓

```

## Performance Targets Summary

| Component | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Query Executor | <1ms P95 | 10-result queries |
| Evidence Aggregation | <100μs | 10 evidence sources |
| Uncertainty Tracking | <1% overhead | Added to base query latency |
| Calibration Error | <5% | Across all confidence bins |
| Query Operations | <1ms P95 | AND/OR/NOT combinations |
| Confidence Correlation | >0.9 | Spearman rank correlation |

## Enhanced Task Specifications

All 7 tasks include:
1. **Precise File Paths** - Exact locations for new/modified code
2. **Integration Points** - Connections to existing activation, HNSW, decay systems
3. **Code Examples** - Concrete implementations with type signatures
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - 6-10 testable requirements per task
5. **Testing Strategies** - Unit, integration, property, and stress tests
6. **Risk Mitigation** - Specific strategies for complexity, performance, correctness

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- All probability operations formally verified with Z3
- Confidence scores correlate >0.9 with retrieval accuracy
- Sub-millisecond P95 latencies for core operations
- Zero allocations in hot path for evidence aggregation

### Mathematical Rigor
- Probability axioms enforced via SMT verification
- Bayesian updating matches analytical solutions <1% error
- Calibration error <5% across all confidence bins
- Property tests verify 10K+ random scenarios

### Production Readiness
- Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, property, stress)
- HTTP API endpoints for query and calibration monitoring
- Streaming telemetry integration
- Operations documentation with deployment guides

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start each task** by reading specification from MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md
2. **Implement incrementally** with tests at each phase boundary
3. **Use feature flags** for SMT verification (optional dependency)
4. **Validate integration** with existing confidence aggregation, spreading activation
5. **Document decisions** in ADRs for architectural deviations
6. **Test edge cases** extensively for probability boundary conditions

## Integration with Existing System

Milestone 5 extends rather than replaces existing functionality:
- Builds on `ProbabilisticQueryResult` from `query/mod.rs`
- Uses `ConfidenceAggregator` from `activation/confidence_aggregation.rs`
- Integrates with `SpreadingMetrics` for uncertainty signals
- Connects to existing HTTP API in `engram-cli/src/api.rs`
- Preserves graceful degradation principles from Milestone 0

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items (P0)
- **Probability Correctness**: SMT verification catches axiom violations at development time
- **Performance Degradation**: Benchmark suite with Criterion catches regressions >5%
- **Calibration Accuracy**: Empirical testing with >1000 samples per bin

### Medium-Risk Items (P1)
- **Integration Complexity**: Incremental integration with backward-compatible APIs
- **Memory Pressure**: Lock-free structures with bounded memory usage
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: Property tests verify mathematical soundness

### Mitigation Approaches
- Feature flags for SMT verification (development only)
- Phased rollout with comprehensive monitoring
- Differential testing against NumPy/R/Mathematica
- Property-based testing with 10K+ random scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Review** MILESTONE_5_6_ROADMAP.md for complete technical specifications
2. **Begin** with Task 001 (Query Executor Core)
3. **Set up** SMT verification in CI (feature-gated)
4. **Track progress** daily against critical path
5. **Monitor** performance benchmarks at each task completion
