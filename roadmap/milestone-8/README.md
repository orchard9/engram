# Milestone 8: Pattern Completion - Implementation Overview

## Executive Summary

Milestone 8 implements production-ready `complete()` operation for reconstructing missing episode details using learned patterns. The system achieves >80% reconstruction accuracy on corrupted episodes while maintaining strict source attribution (recalled vs reconstructed) with calibrated confidence scores. Implementation integrates hippocampal CA3 attractor dynamics with semantic pattern knowledge from consolidation, delivering biologically-plausible pattern completion that matches human performance on standard memory tasks.

## Critical Path Analysis

**Total Duration:** 19 days
**Parallel Track Utilization:** Two parallel tracks converge at integration phase

### Phase Breakdown

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Distinguishing Reconstructed vs Original Parts

**Problem:** Users must know which episode fields are genuine recalls versus pattern-completed reconstructions to avoid false memories.

**Solution:**
- `SourceMap` data structure mapping each field to `MemorySource` enum (Recalled/Reconstructed/Imagined/Consolidated)
- Per-field confidence scores indicating reliability of source attribution
- Source monitoring based on activation pathway analysis (direct recall has higher confidence)
- Alternative hypotheses ranked by System 2 reasoning showing competing reconstructions

**Validation:** Property tests verify source attribution precision >90% on test sets with known ground truth.

### Challenge 2: Combining Local Context + Global Patterns

**Problem:** Completion must use both immediate temporal/spatial context and abstract semantic patterns without over-fitting to either.

**Solution:**
- Hierarchical evidence aggregation: Local context (temporal neighbors) weighted by recency, global patterns (semantic clusters) weighted by statistical strength
- Bayesian evidence combination with explicit priors from consolidation statistics
- Entorhinal grid cells for spatial/temporal context encoding
- Pattern strength modulates influence: Strong patterns (p<0.01) get higher weight
- Adaptive weighting based on cue completeness: Sparse cues favor global patterns, rich cues favor local context

**Validation:** Ablation studies showing both components necessary for >80% accuracy; neither alone exceeds 65%.

### Challenge 3: Calibrating Confidence for Reconstructed Details

**Problem:** Reconstructed fields need well-calibrated confidence scores that accurately reflect reconstruction reliability.

**Solution:**
- Multi-factor confidence computation: CA3 convergence speed, attractor basin depth, pattern strength, source consensus
- Empirical calibration framework tracking reconstruction accuracy per confidence bin
- Metacognitive confidence signal from System 2 reasoner checking internal consistency
- Confidence degradation for each hop from recalled anchor points
- Statistical validation using p-values from pattern detection

**Validation:** Calibration error <8% across 10 confidence bins on validation sets; Spearman correlation >0.80 between confidence and accuracy.

### Challenge 4: Preventing Hallucination/Confabulation

**Problem:** Pattern completion can generate plausible but incorrect details (confabulation), especially with sparse cues.

**Solution:**
- CA1 output gating with threshold (default 0.7): Low-confidence completions explicitly marked as uncertain
- Multiple alternative hypotheses from System 2 reasoning prevent single-path confabulation
- Statistical significance filtering: Only patterns with p<0.01 contribute to reconstruction
- Plausibility scoring using global embedding coherence (HNSW neighborhood consistency)
- Explicit "insufficient evidence" returns rather than forced completion

**Validation:** Human evaluation confirms plausibility >75%; false detail rate <10% for high-confidence completions.

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items (P0)

**Risk: Reconstruction Accuracy <80%**
- **Mitigation:** Extensive validation with standard memory datasets (DRM paradigm, serial position curves)
- **Contingency:** Adjust CA3 sparsity and convergence thresholds based on empirical accuracy
- **Monitoring:** Track accuracy metrics per pattern type; alert if any category <75%

**Risk: Source Attribution Failures**
- **Mitigation:** Ground truth labels in test suite; property-based tests for attribution logic
- **Contingency:** Conservative source labeling (mark ambiguous cases as "reconstructed" with lower confidence)
- **Monitoring:** Per-field source precision/recall metrics in production

**Risk: Confabulation/Hallucination**
- **Mitigation:** CA1 gating threshold, statistical significance filters, plausibility scoring
- **Contingency:** Explicit "insufficient evidence" returns; require minimum cue strength
- **Monitoring:** Human evaluation of random sample; confabulation rate alerts

### Medium-Risk Items (P1)

**Risk: Latency Exceeds 10ms P95**
- **Mitigation:** SIMD optimization for CA3 dynamics, pattern cache with LRU eviction
- **Contingency:** Async completion with streaming results; progressive refinement
- **Monitoring:** P50/P95/P99 latency tracking; alerts at 8ms P95

**Risk: Confidence Miscalibration**
- **Mitigation:** Empirical calibration framework from M5; regular recalibration on validation sets
- **Contingency:** Conservative confidence (underestimate when uncertain)
- **Monitoring:** Per-bin calibration error; weekly calibration drift checks

**Risk: Memory Growth with Pattern Cache**
- **Mitigation:** Bounded cache with LRU eviction; configurable max size
- **Contingency:** Disable caching if memory exceeds threshold
- **Monitoring:** Cache size, hit rate, eviction rate metrics

### Mitigation Approaches

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, property-based, accuracy, biological plausibility tests
- **Gradual Rollout:** Feature flag for completion endpoint; A/B test confidence thresholds
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Return partial episodes with explicit confidence when completion fails
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards; automated accuracy sampling
- **Human Validation:** Weekly review of random completion samples; plausibility ratings

## Parameter Tuning Strategy

### Critical Parameters

**CA3 Dynamics:**
- `ca3_sparsity` (default 0.05): Controls attractor basin depth
  - Lower (0.02-0.03): Sharper attractors, faster convergence, risk of spurious completions
  - Higher (0.08-0.10): Smoother attractors, more iterations, better generalization
  - Tune based on: Convergence rate vs reconstruction accuracy tradeoff

**CA1 Gating:**
- `ca1_threshold` (default 0.7): Minimum confidence for completion output
  - Lower (0.5-0.6): More completions, higher recall, risk of confabulation
  - Higher (0.8-0.9): Fewer completions, high precision, many "insufficient evidence" returns
  - Tune based on: Application tolerance for false details vs completeness

**Pattern Integration:**
- `pattern_weight` (default 0.5): Balance between local context and global patterns
  - Lower (0.2-0.4): Favor local temporal/spatial context
  - Higher (0.6-0.8): Favor semantic patterns from consolidation
  - Tune based on: Cue sparsity (sparse cues need higher pattern weight)

**System 2 Reasoning:**
- `num_hypotheses` (default 3): Alternative completions to generate
  - Lower (1-2): Faster, single best-guess, risk of confirmation bias
  - Higher (5-10): Slower, comprehensive alternatives, better coverage
  - Tune based on: Latency budget vs application need for alternatives

### Tuning Process

1. **Baseline Establishment:** Run validation suite with default parameters, record accuracy/latency baselines
2. **Single-Parameter Sweeps:** Vary each parameter independently, measure impact on accuracy and latency
3. **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Use Pareto frontier to identify parameter sets balancing accuracy/latency/precision
4. **Workload-Specific Tuning:** Adjust parameters based on application characteristics (sparse vs rich cues, precision vs recall preference)
5. **A/B Testing:** Deploy parameter variants to production subsets, compare real-world performance
6. **Continuous Refinement:** Weekly review of accuracy metrics, adjust parameters based on drift

## Graceful Degradation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Matching Patterns Available

**Condition:** Cue doesn't match any consolidated semantic patterns (new/rare context)

**Response:**
- Fall back to local context only (temporal neighbors, spatial proximity)
- Return partial episode with explicit `completion_confidence: 0.4` (low)
- Source attribution marks all fields as `reconstructed` with `confidence < 0.5`
- Alternative hypotheses empty or very low confidence
- HTTP 200 OK with warning header `X-Completion-Status: DegradedLocalOnly`

### Scenario 2: Insufficient Cue Strength

**Condition:** Partial episode has <30% field coverage and very sparse embedding

**Response:**
- Return HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity with actionable error
- Message: "Insufficient pattern information for completion"
- Suggest: Provide additional context fields (which ones needed)
- No forced completion (avoid confabulation)

### Scenario 3: CA3 Convergence Failure

**Condition:** Attractor dynamics don't converge within max_iterations (conflicting patterns)

**Response:**
- Return best-effort partial completion with explicit `convergence_achieved: false`
- Completion confidence penalized by 30% for non-convergence
- Include divergence metric in `reconstruction_stats`
- Log warning for monitoring (potential parameter tuning signal)

### Scenario 4: Low Plausibility Score

**Condition:** Completed episode embedding inconsistent with HNSW neighborhood (implausible reconstruction)

**Response:**
- Gate output through CA1 threshold despite convergence
- Return insufficient evidence if plausibility <0.5
- Include plausibility score in response for client decision
- Generate alternative hypotheses with different pattern weights

## Next Steps

1. **Review** This README and individual task specifications in detail
2. **Begin** Task 001: Reconstruction Primitives (field-level completion logic)
3. **Validate** CA3 dynamics against Hopfield network literature for correctness
4. **Establish** Ground truth test datasets for accuracy validation (DRM paradigm, serial position)
5. **Monitor** Reconstruction accuracy, source attribution precision, confidence calibration from day 1
6. **Tune** Parameters based on empirical accuracy vs latency tradeoffs
7. **Document** Biological plausibility validation and cognitive psychology alignment
