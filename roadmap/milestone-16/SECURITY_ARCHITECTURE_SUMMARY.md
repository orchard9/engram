# Security Architecture Summary - Task 008 Enhancement

## Overview

Task 008 has been enhanced with production-grade security specifications based on decades of experience building secure distributed systems. The architecture implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Transport Security (TLS/mTLS)

**Decision**: Enforce TLS 1.3+ with AEAD cipher suites only
- **Rationale**: TLS 1.3 eliminates known vulnerabilities in older protocols
- **Implementation**: Separate configurations for HTTP/REST (TLS) and gRPC (mTLS)
- **Performance**: ~50ms handshake overhead, mitigated by session resumption
- **Operations**: Hot-reload certificates without downtime via atomic swaps

### 2. Authentication Strategy

**Decision**: Support multiple authentication mechanisms
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service and CLI usage (Argon2id hashing)
- **JWT Tokens**: For web applications and OAuth2 flows
- **mTLS**: For high-security inter-service communication
- **Rationale**: Different use cases require different auth methods
- **Performance**: <10ms validation with 5-minute cache TTL

### 3. Authorization Model

**Decision**: Memory space-based isolation with fine-grained permissions
- **Rationale**: Natural alignment with Engram's memory space architecture
- **Implementation**: Each principal has allowed spaces + permissions
- **Permissions**: Read/Write/Delete/Consolidate/Introspect/Admin
- **Performance**: <5ms authorization checks with permission caching

### 4. Secrets Management

**Decision**: Pluggable integration with external secret stores
- **Supported**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, K8s Secrets
- **Rationale**: Enterprises have existing secret infrastructure
- **Implementation**: Abstraction layer with provider-specific adapters
- **Caching**: 5-minute TTL reduces external calls by >90%

### 5. Audit Logging

**Decision**: Structured security event logging with remote sink support
- **Events**: Authentication, Authorization, Data Access, Configuration
- **Format**: JSON structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Performance**: Async batched writes, non-blocking
- **Integration**: SIEM-compatible output format

## Security Layers

```
External → TLS → Authentication → Authorization → Audit → Memory Space
```

Each layer provides independent security guarantees:
1. **TLS**: Encryption in transit
2. **Authentication**: Identity verification
3. **Authorization**: Access control
4. **Audit**: Forensics and compliance
5. **Memory Space**: Tenant isolation

## Performance Characteristics

Based on the architecture, expected latencies:
- TLS handshake: ~50ms (first connection)
- Authentication: ~10ms (5ms with cache hit)
- Authorization: ~5ms (2ms with cache hit)
- Total overhead: ~15ms for authenticated requests

Memory overhead:
- Auth cache: ~100KB per 1000 active sessions
- Audit buffer: ~1MB for 10K events
- TLS session cache: ~4KB per connection

## Operational Considerations

### Certificate Management
- Automated generation scripts for development
- Integration with Let's Encrypt for production
- Certificate rotation without downtime
- OCSP stapling for revocation checking

### Credential Lifecycle
- API keys expire after configurable period
- JWT tokens use short-lived access + refresh pattern
- Service accounts use rotating credentials
- All secrets fetched from external stores

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time authentication failures
- Authorization denials by principal
- Rate limit violations
- Certificate expiration warnings

### Incident Response
- Correlation IDs link all related events
- Audit trail for forensic analysis
- Token revocation for immediate access termination
- Rate limiting prevents abuse during incidents

## Compliance Alignment

The architecture addresses key compliance requirements:

### SOC2 Type II
- Access control (CC6.1): Multi-factor authentication support
- Encryption (CC6.7): TLS 1.3+ for data in transit
- Logging (CC7.1): Comprehensive audit logging
- Monitoring (A1.2): Security event monitoring

### GDPR
- Access control (Article 32): Strong authentication
- Audit trails (Article 30): Processing activity records
- Encryption (Article 32): Transport encryption
- Isolation (Article 32): Memory space separation

### OWASP Top 10
- A01 Broken Access Control: Authorization engine
- A02 Cryptographic Failures: TLS 1.3+, Argon2id
- A03 Injection: Parameterized queries, input validation
- A04 Insecure Design: Defense in depth
- A05 Security Misconfiguration: Hardening checklist
- A07 Identification/Auth Failures: Multi-factor support
- A09 Security Logging: Comprehensive audit trail
- A10 SSRF: Restricted internal network access

## Migration Path

For existing deployments, implement security in phases:

### Phase 1: Transport Security (Week 1)
1. Generate certificates
2. Enable TLS on HTTP endpoints
3. Configure mTLS for gRPC
4. Update clients

### Phase 2: Authentication (Week 2)
1. Generate initial API keys
2. Configure JWT validation
3. Update applications
4. Enable auth enforcement

### Phase 3: Authorization (Week 3)
1. Define permission model
2. Assign permissions to principals
3. Enable authorization checks
4. Monitor and tune

### Phase 4: Hardening (Week 4)
1. Run hardening scripts
2. Enable audit logging
3. Configure monitoring
4. Perform security scan

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- TLS configuration validation
- Authentication mechanism tests
- Authorization rule evaluation
- Audit event generation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end authentication flows
- Memory space access control
- Secret rotation handling
- Certificate renewal

### Security Tests

## Key Improvements Over Baseline

The enhanced Task 008 specification provides:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All security aspects from transport to audit
2. **Production Ready**: Includes operational procedures and monitoring
3. **Performance Optimized**: Caching strategies minimize overhead
4. **Compliance Aligned**: Addresses SOC2, GDPR, OWASP requirements
5. **Operationally Focused**: Clear procedures for common tasks
6. **Testable**: Specific validation criteria and test strategies

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Memory Safety
- Use SecretString type to prevent secrets in memory dumps
- Clear sensitive data with explicit zeroing
- Implement constant-time comparisons for crypto operations

### Concurrency
- Lock-free caching with DashMap for high throughput
- Async audit logging to prevent blocking
- Connection pooling for external secret stores

### Error Handling
- Never leak sensitive information in errors
- Log security failures for monitoring
- Implement exponential backoff for failed auth

### Monitoring
- Export metrics for all security operations
- Alert on anomalous authentication patterns
- Track certificate expiration proactively

This architecture provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining Engram's performance requirements. The modular design allows gradual adoption based on deployment requirements.
