**Agent**: verification-testing-lead
**Grade**: C (blocking issue)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Prometheus configuration and alert rules
- ✅ Loki log aggregation setup
- ✅ Excellent documentation (monitoring.md, alerting.md)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: 4 Grafana dashboard JSON files missing

**Agent**: rust-graph-engine-architect
**Grade**: B (specification complete, implementation pending)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Migration infrastructure (migration-common, 964 LOC)
- ✅ Neo4j migration tool (stub with architecture)
- ⚠️ PostgreSQL migration tool (minimal stub)
- ⚠️ Redis migration tool (minimal stub)
- ✅ Complete migration documentation (5 files)
- ✅ Validation script

**Technical Quality**:
- Excellent migration-common architecture (validators, streaming, checkpointing)

- Code quality is high where implemented

**Issues Found**:
1. **STATUS MISMATCH**: Task marked "complete" but implementation is intentionally stubbed
2. Migration tools excluded from workspace build in Cargo.toml
3. Integration with engram-core storage layer not implemented (placeholder comments)
4. PostgreSQL and Redis tools less complete than Neo4j

**Technical Debt**: Moderate - need to either:
- Document this as Phase 1 (architecture) with integration deferred
- OR mark task as "in_progress" until full implementation
- OR clearly state stub status in task file

**Recommendation**: Update task file header to reflect stub implementation reality

---

### ✅ Task 008: Security Hardening & Authentication (COMPLETE)
**Agent**: systems-architecture-optimizer
**Grade**: A

**Deliverables**:

**Issues Found**: None (duplicate stub file removed)
**Technical Debt**: None

**Note**: Task provides comprehensive specifications; actual Rust implementation is part of engram-core (not operational scripts)

---

**Issues Found**: 2 (BOTH FIXED)
1. **CRITICAL**: 9 of 10 API example directories missing
   - Created comprehensive README files for all 9 directories
2. **MINOR**: Broken documentation link fixed

**Technical Debt**: Minimal - example directories have README stubs, actual code in 5 languages needed as follow-up

---

### ✅ Task 010: Configuration Reference & Best Practices (COMPLETE)
**Agent**: technical-communication-lead
**Grade**: A+

**Deliverables**:
- Complete configuration parameter reference (46KB, 1,892 lines)

- ❌ Comparative benchmarks are stub implementations
- ❌ **MISSING**: Baseline benchmark results documentation

**Technical Quality**:
- Load testing implementation is rigorous and production-ready
- Statistical analysis is sophisticated
- Chaos engineering coverage is comprehensive

**Issues Found**:
1. FaissTarget and Neo4jTarget contain only TODOs (cannot run differential testing as claimed)
2. Missing: `/docs/reference/benchmark-results.md` with empirical baselines

**Technical Debt**: Minor - need baseline results for regression detection

**Estimated Fix**: 16-22 hours

---

### ⚠️ Task 012: Operations CLI Enhancement (COMPLETE but BLOCKED)
**Agent**: rust-graph-engine-architect
**Grade**: A (implementation complete, blocked by external issue)

**Deliverables**:

- Comprehensive script integration

**Issues Found**: 2 (BOTH FIXED)
1. Edition 2024 compatibility in backup.rs (if-let chains) - FIXED
2. Edition 2024 compatibility in build.rs - FIXED

**Blocking Issue**: Edition 2024 compatibility in engram-core (NOT in this task's code)
- 60+ instances of if-let chains across 7 files in engram-core
- This is codebase maintenance, not a Task 012 deliverable
- Task 012 code itself is clean and complete

**Technical Debt**: None in Task 012 deliverables

**Status**: Functionally complete, commit blocked by engram-core Edition 2024 migration
