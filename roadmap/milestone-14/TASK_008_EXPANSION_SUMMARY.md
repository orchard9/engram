# Task 008 Expansion Summary

## Overview

Successfully expanded Task 008 (Conflict Resolution for Divergent Consolidations) from a 27-line summary to a comprehensive 1,299-line specification matching the depth of Tasks 001-003.

## File Locations

**New Comprehensive Task File:**
`/Users/jordan/Workspace/orchard9/engram/roadmap/milestone-14/008_conflict_resolution_divergent_consolidations_pending.md`

**Original Summary (to be replaced):**
Lines 120-146 in `/Users/jordan/Workspace/orchard9/engram/roadmap/milestone-14/004-012_remaining_tasks_pending.md`

## What Was Added

### 1. Research Foundation (350+ lines)

**Neuroscience Basis:**
- Hippocampal pattern separation vs completion (DG vs CA3)
- Competing memory traces and reconsolidation interference
- Selective inhibition of competing engrams
- Schema consistency effects in neocortex
- Biological plausibility validation against empirical findings

**Distributed Systems Basis:**
- Vector clocks for causality tracking (Fidge 1988)
- CRDTs and convergence guarantees (Shapiro et al. 2011)
- Operational transformation for concurrent edits
- Comparison of LWW vs multi-value vs semantic merge strategies

### 2. Technical Specification (600+ lines)

**Four Distinct Conflict Types:**
1. **Divergent Episode Consolidation**: Same episodes → different patterns
2. **Concurrent Pattern Creation**: Similar semantics, different episodes
3. **Concurrent Updates**: Same pattern updated by multiple nodes
4. **Episode Ownership**: Same episode in multiple patterns

**Core Data Structures (200 lines):**
- `VectorClock` with causality comparison (Before/After/Equal/Concurrent)
- `DistributedPattern` with vector clock, confidence, embeddings
- `ConflictDetection` with similarity and overlap metrics
- `ResolutionStrategy` enum with 6 strategies
- `ResolutionResult` with determinism guarantees

**Core Operations (400 lines):**

1. **Conflict Detection** (`ConflictDetector`):
   - Cosine similarity for semantic comparison
   - Jaccard overlap for episode intersection
   - Automatic conflict type classification
   - Strategy recommendation based on characteristics

2. **Pattern Merging** (`PatternMerger`):
   - Confidence-weighted embedding averaging
   - Similarity-based confidence penalties
   - Conservative dual (keep both with reduced confidence)
   - Confidence voting (higher confidence wins)
   - Multi-membership (episode splits across patterns)

3. **Resolution Orchestration** (`ConflictResolver`):
   - Deterministic resolution guarantees
   - Commutative and associative merge operations
   - No data loss for high-confidence patterns
   - Metrics tracking and monitoring integration

### 3. Testing Strategy (250+ lines)

**Unit Tests:**
- Vector clock causality relationships
- Conflict type detection accuracy
- Merge determinism (same inputs → same output)
- Confidence adjustment correctness
- Information preservation guarantees

**Property-Based Tests (PropTest):**
- Determinism proof for all conflict types
- Commutativity: resolve(A, B) = resolve(B, A)
- Associativity: resolve(resolve(A, B), C) = resolve(A, resolve(B, C))
- No confidence inflation (output ≤ max(inputs))
- Convergence under arbitrary input ordering

**Integration Tests:**
- Two-node divergent consolidation scenario
- Gossip exchange with conflict resolution
- Convergence validation (both nodes reach same state)
- Information loss measurement

### 4. Biological Plausibility Section (100+ lines)

**Hippocampal Analogies:**
- DG pattern separation → ConservativeDual strategy (low similarity)
- CA3 pattern completion → ConfidenceWeightedMerge (high similarity)
- Reconsolidation interference → ConcurrentUpdate handling
- Overlapping engrams → MultiMembership strategy

**Validation Criteria:**
- Distinct patterns (similarity <0.6) should not merge
- Similar patterns (similarity >0.85) should merge
- More recent/confident updates dominate
- Episode membership can be non-exclusive

## Key Innovations

### 1. Biologically-Inspired Resolution
- Similarity thresholds (0.85 for merge, 0.60 for separate) derived from hippocampal dynamics
- Confidence-weighted integration mirrors frequency-dependent memory dominance
- Multi-membership strategy reflects overlapping cortical engrams

### 2. Determinism Guarantees
- All resolution strategies are deterministic (same inputs → same output)
- Property-based tests prove commutativity and associativity
- Vector clocks provide causal ordering without global time
- CRDT-inspired design ensures convergence

### 3. Confidence Calibration
- Similarity-based penalties (high divergence → low confidence)
- Conservative strategies preserve information with reduced confidence
- No confidence inflation (merged ≤ max of inputs)
- Uncertainty reflected in final confidence scores

### 4. Zero Data Loss Options
- ConservativeDual: Keep both patterns, reduce confidence
- MultiMembership: Episode belongs to multiple patterns
- Information loss metric tracks discarded information
- High-confidence patterns never silently deleted

## Implementation Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days (increased from 2 days due to comprehensive scope)

**Day 1:** Vector clock implementation + conflict detection
**Day 2:** Pattern merging algorithms (all 5 strategies)
**Day 3:** Resolution orchestrator + metrics integration
**Day 4:** Unit tests + property-based tests
**Day 5:** Integration tests + biological plausibility validation

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Have team review expanded specification for technical soundness
2. **Update Parent Task**: Replace lines 120-146 in `004-012_remaining_tasks_pending.md` with reference to new file
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure Task 007 (Gossip Protocol) exports necessary interfaces
4. **Implementation**: Begin with vector clock (most foundational component)
