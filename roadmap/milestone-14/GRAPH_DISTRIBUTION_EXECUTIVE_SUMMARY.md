# M14 Graph Distribution: Executive Summary

**TL;DR**: Original M14 estimate of 18-24 days is **8-13x too low** when accounting for graph-specific distributed challenges. Realistic estimate: **37-52 weeks**.

---

## Three Critical Graph Problems Missing from M14 Plan

### 1. Distributed Activation Spreading (8-12 weeks)

**Current Plan**: "Scatter-gather with confidence penalty" (3 days)

**Reality**: Multi-hop spreading across partitions requires:
- Distributed BFS with Lamport clocks (2-3 weeks)
- Distributed cycle detection using vector clocks (2-3 weeks)
- Activation-weighted confidence aggregation (1 week)
- Performance tuning for network batching (2-3 weeks)

**Latency Impact**:
- Original target: <2x single-node
- Realistic: **5-10x single-node** (network RTTs dominate)
- 3-hop spreading: 1ms → 7-10ms (3 network round-trips)

**Underestimate**: **13-20x**

### 2. HNSW Index Distribution (5-7 weeks)

**Current Plan**: Not mentioned at all (0 weeks)

**Reality**: HNSW replication requires:
- Deterministic construction (1-2 weeks) - **CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**
- WAL-based replication protocol (1-2 weeks)
- Topology consistency validation (2 weeks)
- Query routing (1 week)

**Memory Overhead**:
- Full replication: 3x (acceptable for M14 scale)
- Partitioned HNSW: **open research problem**, infeasible for M14

**Key Issue**: Current HNSW construction is **non-deterministic**:
```rust
// Random layer assignment
fn select_layer(&self) -> u8 {
    let uniform = rand::thread_rng().gen::<f32>();
    (-uniform.ln() * self.ml).floor() as u8  // RANDOM!
}
```

→ Primary and replica build **different graph topologies**
→ Searches return **different results**
→ Violates distributed consistency guarantees

**Fix Required Before M14 Starts**: Deterministic construction using content-based hashing (2 weeks)

### 3. Graph Topology Consistency (10-14 weeks)

**Current Plan**: "Gossip protocol with vector clocks" (6 days)

**Reality**: Graph mutations are NOT naturally convergent:
- Concurrent edge updates require Last-Write-Wins + vector clocks (2-3 weeks)
- Edge weight merging requires CRDT proofs (2 weeks)
- Version vector anti-entropy (2-3 weeks)
- Hybrid logical clocks for refractory periods (1-2 weeks)
- Jepsen-style convergence testing (3-4 weeks)

**Conflict Scenario Example**:
```
Node A consolidates: "AI" ↔ "neural networks" (weight 0.9)
Node B consolidates: "AI" ↔ "neural networks" (weight 0.85)
```

Which is correct? **Both** (different local observations).

**Solution**: Confidence-weighted CRDT merge:
```rust
merged_weight = (w1 * conf1 + w2 * conf2) / (conf1 + conf2)
```

**Proof Required**: Commutativity + associativity → convergence guarantee

**Underestimate**: **8-12x**

## Effort Comparison

| Component | M14 Plan | Graph Reality | Factor |
|-----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Activation Spreading | 3 days | 8-12 weeks | **13-20x** |
| HNSW Distribution | 0 days | 5-7 weeks | **∞** |
| Graph Topology | 6 days | 10-14 weeks | **8-12x** |
| **Subtotal (Graph)** | **9 days** | **23-33 weeks** | **13-18x** |
| Systems Infrastructure | 9 days | 8-12 weeks | 4-7x |
| **Total M14** | **18 days** | **31-45 weeks** | **8-13x** |

**Including Prerequisites** (determinism, baselines): **37-52 weeks total**

---

## Why the Underestimate?

The M14 plan is written from a **systems architecture** perspective (Bryan Cantrill persona), which correctly identifies:
- SWIM membership protocol complexity
- Gossip anti-entropy overhead
- Jepsen validation requirements

But **misses graph-specific challenges**:

1. **Activation spreading is NOT a database query**
   - Database query: scatter-gather to N partitions, merge results
   - Spreading: **iterative multi-hop** BFS requiring N round-trips
   - Latency: O(hops × RTT), not O(RTT)

2. **HNSW is NOT a B-tree index**
   - B-tree: log(N) sharding is well-understood
   - HNSW: hierarchical small-world graph, partitioning breaks invariants
   - Only known solution: full replication (memory-expensive)

3. **Graph edges are NOT append-only logs**
   - Episodic memories: append-only, trivial replication
   - Semantic edges: mutable weights, require conflict resolution
   - CRDTs for numeric merging: requires mathematical proofs

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Defer M14 to M18+ (Recommended)

**Rationale**:
- Single-node supports millions of memories (10M × 4KB = 40GB)
- Production workload unknown (premature optimization)
- Distributed graph is research problem (no proven implementations)

**Timeline**:
1. M13: Finish cognitive patterns (2-3 weeks)
2. M14-prereqs: Determinism + baselines (6-7 weeks)
3. M16-M17: Single-node production hardening (8-12 weeks)
4. M18: Graph distribution research (8-12 weeks)
5. M19: Production distributed graph (20-30 weeks)

**Total to Production Distributed**: **18-24 months**

### Option B: Reduced-Scope M14 (26-36 weeks)

**Scope**:
- HNSW distribution only (nearest-neighbor search)
- No distributed spreading (remains single-node)
- Single memory space (no multi-tenancy)

**Delivers**:
- Distributed storage capacity
- Fault-tolerant recall
- **Does NOT deliver**: distributed spreading activation (key differentiator!)

### Option C: Proceed with Full M14 (37-52 weeks)

**Requirements**:
- Accept 9-12 month timeline
- Complete all prerequisites first (6-7 weeks)
- Allocate research time for HNSW distribution
- Budget for extensive Jepsen validation

**Risk**: High - distributed graph is unproven at scale

## Graph-Specific Prerequisites

**Must complete BEFORE M14 implementation starts**:

1. **Deterministic HNSW Construction** (2 weeks)
   - Replace random layer selection with content-based hash
   - Stable neighbor selection with node ID tie-breaking
   - Property tests: same input → identical topology

2. **HNSW Performance Baselines** (1 week)
   - Insertion: vectors/sec
   - Search: P50/P95/P99 latency
   - Memory: bytes/vector

3. **Vector Clock Implementation** (1 week)
   - Core VectorClock type
   - Happens-before comparisons
   - Merge semantics

4. **Consolidation Determinism** (2-3 weeks)
   - Already identified by systems planner
   - Prerequisite for graph topology consistency

**Total Prerequisites**: **6-7 weeks**

**Current M14 Status**: **Prerequisites NOT met**

---

## Bottom Line

**Graph engine distribution is 8-13x more complex than estimated.**

The current M14 plan is architecturally sound for distributed **databases** but misses challenges unique to distributed **graphs**:
- Multi-hop traversal latency
- Non-deterministic HNSW construction
- Graph mutation conflict resolution

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT START M14 NOW**

Focus on:
1. Completing M13 (cognitive patterns)
2. Establishing prerequisites (determinism, baselines)
3. Production hardening of single-node (M16-M17)
4. Research phase for distributed graphs (M18)

**Distributed graphs are hard. Let's do them right, not fast.**
