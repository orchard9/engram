ENGRAM TASK 007: GOSSIP PROTOCOL FOR CONSOLIDATION STATE
Implementation Analysis Complete - Very Thorough Review
=====================================================

ANALYSIS DATE: 2025-11-01
REPORT LOCATION: /Users/jordan/Workspace/orchard9/engram/TASK_007_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

1. CONSOLIDATION STATE IS WELL-STRUCTURED
   - SemanticPattern: /engram-core/src/completion/consolidation.rs:45-65
   - ConsolidationSnapshot: /engram-core/src/completion/consolidation.rs:104-113
   - ConsolidationService trait: /engram-core/src/consolidation/service.rs:54-66
   - Implementation: /engram-core/src/consolidation/service.rs:69-83

2. CONSOLIDATION TRIGGERS ARE IDENTIFIED
   - Primary hook: /engram-core/src/completion/scheduler.rs:206-216
   - Consolidation runs every 300 seconds (default)
   - Minimum 10 episodes required
   - Snapshot contains all current patterns and stats

3. HASH FUNCTIONS ALREADY IN USE
   - Pattern hashing: /engram-core/src/consolidation/pattern_detector.rs:499-506
   - Uses std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher
   - Pattern IDs are deterministic (hash of sorted source episodes)
   - Follow this pattern for Merkle tree implementation

4. SWIM GOSSIP INFRASTRUCTURE (Task 001)
   - Status: PENDING (spec complete, not implemented)
   - Task 001 file: /roadmap/milestone-14/001_cluster_membership_swim_pending.md
   - Ready to piggyback consolidation gossip on SWIM messages
   - Approach: Attach Merkle root to PING messages as metadata

5. CLUSTER MODULE DOESN'T EXIST YET
   - Must create: /engram-core/src/cluster/
   - Subdirectories: cluster/gossip/ and cluster/conflict/
   - 8 files to create total (see full report)

6. CRITICAL INTEGRATION POINT
   - After consolidation snapshot generation (scheduler.rs:216)
   - Add hook: store.consolidation_service().update_merkle_tree(&snapshot)
   - Or: pass gossiper to service and auto-update on snapshot changes

7. HASH FUNCTION DECISION
   - Recommendation: SHA-256 from 'sha2' crate (v0.10)
   - Currently not in dependencies - must add
   - Use for Merkle tree node hashing
   - Hash pattern metadata (id, confidence, timestamp), not embedding

8. SEMANTIC PATTERN STRUCTURE
   - id: String (deterministic, based on source episodes)
   - embedding: [f32; 768] (DON'T hash - too expensive, hash metadata only)
   - source_episodes: Vec<String>
   - strength: f32
   - schema_confidence: Confidence
   - last_consolidated: DateTime<Utc>

9. EXACT FILE LOCATIONS (ALL WITH LINE NUMBERS)
   ✓ SemanticPattern definition: consolidation.rs:45-65
   ✓ ConsolidationSnapshot: consolidation.rs:104-113
   ✓ ConsolidationService trait: service.rs:54-66
   ✓ Consolidation trigger: scheduler.rs:206-216
   ✓ Pattern hashing example: pattern_detector.rs:499-506
   ✓ MemoryStore.consolidation_service: store.rs:7-12
   ✓ Consolidation interval config: scheduler.rs:124-126
   ✓ State storage: service.rs:69-83 (InMemoryConsolidationService)

10. MERKLE TREE DESIGN
    - Depth: 12 (supports 4096 leaf slots)
    - Pattern to leaf: hash(pattern_id) % 4096
    - Leaf hash: SHA-256(sorted patterns in leaf)
    - Internal nodes: SHA-256(left_hash || right_hash)
    - Root: fingerprint of entire consolidation state
    - Incremental updates: O(log N) recomputation on pattern change

IMPLEMENTATION READY:
====================

The codebase is well-structured for Task 007 implementation:
- All consolidation state clearly identified with exact locations
- Consolidation triggers clearly marked
- Hash function patterns established
- SWIM infrastructure spec ready (Task 001)
- Integration approach clear and non-invasive

DELIVERABLE:
============
Report file: TASK_007_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md (726 lines)
Contains:
- Executive summary
- Exact file paths (all with line numbers)
- Code structure and data flow
- Integration points and hooks
- Configuration parameters
- Testing strategy
- Performance targets
- Critical decisions
- Complete acceptance criteria mapping

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Review TASK_007_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md
2. Implement cluster module (8 files)
3. Add sha2 dependency to Cargo.toml
4. Hook gossiper to consolidation scheduler
5. Implement Merkle tree per spec
6. Implement conflict resolution (Task 008)
7. Implement gossip exchange protocol
8. Run tests (unit, property, integration)
