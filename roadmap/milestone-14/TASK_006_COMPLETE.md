6. **Performance Targets**
   - Routing decision: <50μs (p99)
   - Connection pool: <10μs cached
   - Overall routing overhead: <1ms (p99)
   - Memory overhead: <1MB per 100 nodes

7. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - 8 detailed criteria
   - All measurable and testable

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Routing Strategies

Four distinct strategies based on operation type:

| Operation | Strategy | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Store/Update | Primary only | Writes must go to authoritative source |
| Recall | Primary with fallback | Reads can use replicas if primary fails |
| Consolidation | Local only | Synced via gossip, no remote routing |
| Distributed query | Scatter-gather | Query spans multiple partitions |

### 2. Connection Pooling

- **4 gRPC channels per remote node** (default)
- Round-robin selection for load distribution
- HTTP/2 stream multiplexing (100s of RPCs per connection)
- Keep-alive every 30 seconds
- Automatic cleanup on node failure

Rationale: gRPC HTTP/2 already provides stream multiplexing, but multiple connections spread CPU load across cores and provide redundancy.

### 3. Retry Policy

- **Max 3 retries** per operation
- **Exponential backoff**: delay = base * 2^attempt
- **Full jitter**: delay * (0.5 + random(0, 0.5))
- **10-second deadline** for total operation
- **Replica fallback** if all retries to primary fail

Rationale: Matches proven patterns from Google SRE and AWS. Full jitter prevents thundering herd on recovery.

### 4. Circuit Breaker

- **5 consecutive failures** to open (default)
- **30-second timeout** before half-open
- **Single test request** in half-open state
- **Fast-fail** when open (no network calls)

Rationale: Prevents cascading failures. Failed nodes are isolated until proven healthy.

### 5. Partition Handling

During network partition:
- Route to local-only
- Return error if space not local
- Confidence penalty on results
- Resume normal routing after healing

Rationale: Maintains availability during partition while signaling degraded mode to clients.

## Code Quality

All code examples follow Engram conventions:
- ✓ Result-based error handling
- ✓ Arc for shared ownership
- ✓ DashMap for concurrent collections
- ✓ tokio for async runtime
- ✓ tonic for gRPC
- ✓ Structured logging (info!, warn!, error!)
- ✓ Metrics integration
- ✓ Comprehensive error types

## Integration Points

### With Task 001 (SWIM Membership)

```rust
let membership: Arc<SwimMembership> = ...;
let local_node = membership.local_node();
```

### With Task 002 (Discovery)

Connection pool uses discovered node addresses:

```rust
let node = membership.get_node(node_id)?;
let channel = connection_pool.get_channel(&node).await?;
```

### With Task 003 (Partition Handling)

Router checks partition state before routing:

```rust
if partition_detector.is_partitioned().await {
    return self.route_local_only(space_id).await;
}
```

### With Task 004 (Space Assignment)

Router queries assignments to determine targets:

```rust
let assignment = assignments.get_assignment(space_id).await?;
// Returns: SpaceAssignment { primary, replicas }
```

### With Task 005 (Replication)

Router sends writes to primary, which handles async replication to replicas. Router doesn't wait for replica acks.

## Comparison to Tasks 001-003

| Metric | Task 001 | Task 002 | Task 003 | Task 006 | Average |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Total Lines | 666 | 739 | 675 | 1,097 | 794 |
| Research | 150 | 100 | 120 | 250 | 155 |
| Code | 400 | 450 | 420 | 600 | 468 |
| Tests | 100 | 150 | 120 | 150 | 130 |
| Files | 6 | 8 | 6 | 9 | 7 |

Task 006 is **38% longer** than average due to:
- More complex retry/circuit breaker logic
- Multiple routing strategies
- Connection pool implementation
- Extensive research on distributed patterns

## Next Steps for Implementation

When ready to implement Task 006:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites Complete**
   - Task 001: SWIM membership running
   - Task 002: Node discovery working
   - Task 003: Partition detection active

2. **Implementation Order**
   - Start with `circuit_breaker.rs` (standalone, testable)
   - Then `connection_pool.rs` (depends on gRPC)
   - Then `router.rs` (orchestrates everything)
   - Finally integrate with gRPC API

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit test circuit breaker thoroughly
   - Integration test with 3-node cluster
   - Benchmark routing overhead
   - Chaos test partition scenarios

4. **Validation**
   - Measure p99 routing latency
   - Verify connection reuse
   - Test replica fallback
   - Confirm circuit breaker opens/closes

## Supporting Documentation

## How to Use

### Option 1: Replace Section in 004-012 File

Edit `/Users/jordan/Workspace/orchard9/engram/roadmap/milestone-14/004-012_remaining_tasks_pending.md`:

**Remove lines 56-84** (current Task 006 summary)

**Replace with**:
```markdown
## Task 006: Distributed Routing Layer

See detailed specification: `006_distributed_routing_layer_pending.md`

**Duration**: 3 days
**Dependencies**: Tasks 001, 002, 003
```

### Option 2: Use Standalone File

Reference the new file directly:

```bash
cat roadmap/milestone-14/006_distributed_routing_layer_pending.md
```
