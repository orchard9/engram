# Milestone 11 Planning Summary

## What Was Created

This milestone plan defines a **production-ready streaming interface** for Engram that supports:

- 100K observations/second sustained throughput
- Bidirectional streaming (push observations + pull recalls in same stream)
- Lock-free incremental indexing with bounded staleness (100ms P99 visibility)
- Chaos-tested correctness (10-minute sustained failure injection)
- Multi-protocol support (gRPC + WebSocket)

## Core Technical Decisions

### 1. Eventual Consistency with Bounded Staleness

**Decision:** NOT linearizable, NOT strongly consistent. Eventual consistency with 100ms P99 visibility guarantee.

**Rationale:** Biological memory formation is probabilistic. Human episodic memory doesn't provide linearizable guarantees. We model cognitive reality.

**Guarantees:**
- Intra-stream total ordering (sequence numbers)
- Atomic visibility (no partial observations)
- Bounded staleness (100ms P99)
- No silent drops (explicit errors)

### 2. Space-Based Worker Sharding + Work Stealing

**Problem:** Single-threaded HNSW insertion: 10K ops/sec. Need 100K ops/sec.

**Solution:**
- 4-8 parallel workers, each owns subset of memory spaces (zero contention)
- Work stealing when one space gets 10x more traffic
- Linear scaling up to number of active spaces

**Result:** 8 workers × 10K ops/sec = 80K ops/sec baseline, exceeds 100K with headroom.

### 3. SegQueue with Priority Lanes

**Replaced:** Bounded ArrayQueue (blocks when full)

**With:** Unbounded SegQueue with 3 priority lanes (High/Normal/Low)

**Safety:** Soft capacity limits trigger backpressure before hard limit. Admission control rejects when overloaded.

### 4. Batch-Aware HNSW Insertion

**Observation:** Single HNSW insert: ~100μs. Batch of 100: ~3ms = 30μs each (3x speedup).

**Strategy:** Adaptive batching - small batches (10) under low load for latency, large batches (500) under high load for throughput.

## Implementation Tasks (12 tasks, 18 days with 2 engineers)

### Critical Path (13 days)

1. **Protocol Foundation (3d):** Protobuf messages, session management, sequence numbers
2. **Lock-Free Queue (2d):** SegQueue with priority lanes, backpressure detection
3. **Worker Pool (4d):** Multi-threaded workers with space sharding and work stealing
4. **Batch HNSW (3d):** Optimize HNSW for batch insertions (3-5x speedup)
5. **gRPC Streaming (3d):** Bidirectional stream handlers with flow control
6. **Backpressure (2d):** Adaptive admission control and batching under load
7. **Snapshot Recall (3d):** Recall with snapshot isolation and incremental streaming

### Parallel Tracks (5 days)

8. **WebSocket (2d):** Browser-friendly streaming
9. **Chaos Testing (3d):** Fault injection, eventual consistency validation
10. **Performance Tuning (2d):** Benchmark and optimize for 100K ops/sec
11. **Monitoring (2d):** Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting
12. **Integration (2d):** End-to-end tests, client examples, operational runbook

## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks

**1. Lock Contention in HNSW (CRITICAL)**
- Probability: HIGH
- Impact: Blocks 100K ops/sec target
- Mitigation: Microbenchmark before Task 003, fallback to per-layer locks or space partitioning

**2. Unbounded Queue Growth (HIGH)**
- Probability: MEDIUM
- Impact: OOM crash
- Mitigation: Soft + hard capacity limits, monitoring alerts, load shedding

**3. Temporal Ordering Violations (MEDIUM)**
- Probability: MEDIUM
- Impact: Correctness bug
- Mitigation: Sequence number validation, property testing, chaos testing

## Detailed Task Files Created

The following detailed task specifications have been created in `roadmap/milestone-11/`:

1. **001_streaming_protocol_foundation_pending.md** - Protocol design, session management
2. **002_lockfree_observation_queue_pending.md** - SegQueue implementation, priority lanes
3. **003_parallel_hnsw_worker_pool_pending.md** - Multi-threaded workers, work stealing
4. **009_chaos_testing_framework_pending.md** - Comprehensive failure injection testing

**Remaining tasks (004-008, 010-012) need detailed specs.** These follow the same format with:
- Technical specifications
- Code examples
- Files to create/modify
- Testing strategy
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance targets

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** with the team, validate technical decisions
2. **Create remaining task files** (004-008, 010-012) following established format
3. **Begin implementation** starting with Task 001 (Protocol Foundation)
4. **Continuous validation:** Run chaos tests from Day 1, not just at end

## Key Innovations

1. **Cognitive consistency model:** Eventual consistency reflects biological memory formation
2. **Zero-contention parallelism:** Space-based sharding eliminates lock contention
3. **Adaptive batching:** Trade latency for throughput under load
4. **Chaos-driven validation:** 10-minute sustained failure injection proves correctness
5. **Bounded staleness guarantee:** 100ms P99 visibility balances performance and consistency

## Production Deployment Considerations

**Hardware requirements:**
- 4-core CPU minimum (8-core recommended for 100K+ ops/sec)
- 4GB RAM (2GB for observations, 2GB for HNSW index)
- SSD storage for WAL persistence

**Monitoring:**
- Queue depth (alert > 80%)
- Backpressure activation rate
- Worker utilization
- Observation → visibility latency distribution

**Tuning parameters:**
- Worker count (default: num_cores, range: 4-16)
- Queue capacity (default: 100K, range: 10K-1M)
- Batch size (default: adaptive, manual override: 10-1000)

**Failure modes:**
- Worker crash: Auto-restart, work stealing takes over
- Queue overflow: Admission control rejects with error
- Network partition: Client retries with exponential backoff
- HNSW corruption: Graph validation detects, system alerts

This plan provides a complete roadmap from protocol design through chaos-tested production deployment.
