# Task 007: Pattern Completion Engine

## Status: Pending
## Priority: P2 - Advanced Feature
## Estimated Effort: 10 days
## Dependencies: Task 006 (Probabilistic Query Engine), Task 004 (Parallel Activation Spreading)

## Objective
Implement biologically-inspired pattern completion for reconstructing missing parts of episodes using hippocampal-like dynamics and cortical pattern separation, achieving >70% plausibility rating with cognitive confidence calibration.

## Technical Specification

### Core Requirements
1. **Hippocampal Pattern Completion**
   - CA3-inspired autoassociative reconstruction
   - Dentate gyrus pattern separation for disambiguation
   - CA1 output gating with confidence weighting
   - Entorhinal cortex grid cell-like indexing for spatial/temporal context

2. **System 2 Reasoning Integration**
   - Deliberative hypothesis generation using working memory buffers
   - Compositional reasoning for complex pattern reconstruction
   - Attention-based context selection (top-k relevant memories)
   - Credit assignment through time for sequential episodes

3. **Memory Consolidation Dynamics**
   - Sharp-wave ripple-inspired fast replay for pattern extraction
   - Systems consolidation from episodic to semantic representations
   - Complementary learning with fast hippocampal and slow cortical systems
   - Experience replay with prioritized sampling (prediction error-based)

4. **Confidence Scoring with Cognitive Principles**
   - Distinguish original from reconstructed using source monitoring
   - Metacognitive confidence based on retrieval fluency
   - Multiple hypothesis generation with parallel evidence accumulation
   - Winner-take-all selection with lateral inhibition

### Cognitive Plausibility Metrics

1. **Pattern Separation Index** (Dentate Gyrus)
   - Orthogonality between similar patterns: `1 - cos(p1, p2)`
   - Sparsity measure: `||x||_0 / n < 0.05` (5% active neurons)

2. **Attractor Basin Stability** (CA3)
   - Energy landscape: `E = -0.5 * x^T * W * x`
   - Basin of attraction radius via Lyapunov analysis
   - Convergence time to stable state

3. **Retrieval Fluency** (Metacognition)
   - Time to first hypothesis
   - Number of iterations to convergence
   - Activation spread velocity

4. **Source Monitoring Accuracy**
   - Reality monitoring: internal vs external source
   - Temporal source: when was this encoded?
   - Confidence calibration via isotonic regression

### Biologically-Constrained Performance

- **Convergence Time**: 3-7 iterations (~50-100ms) matching theta rhythm
- **Sparsity**: <5% active units (hippocampal sparsity constraint)
- **Capacity**: 0.15N patterns (Hopfield network limit)
- **Energy Efficiency**: Minimize synaptic updates (metabolic constraint)

### Advanced Testing Strategy

1. **Lesion Studies** (Ablation Testing)
   - Remove CA3 → test pattern completion degradation
   - Remove DG → test pattern separation failure
   - Disable System 2 → measure reasoning impact

2. **Behavioral Validation**
   - DRM paradigm: false memory generation
   - Reality monitoring tasks
   - Source confusion under interference

3. **Neural Plausibility**
   - Measure sparse coding statistics
   - Validate attractor dynamics
   - Check oscillation frequencies (theta, gamma, ripples)

4. **Consolidation Testing**
   - Immediate vs delayed recall
   - Semantic extraction over time
   - Retrograde gradient of memory

## Integration Notes

- **HNSW Index** (Task 002): Fast nearest-neighbor for similar patterns
- **Decay Functions** (Task 005): Forgetting curves affect reconstruction confidence
- **Memory Types**: Deep integration with Episode, Memory, and Cue structures
- **Confidence System**: Uses existing Confidence type with upper/lower bounds

## Biological Constraints & Trade-offs

1. **Dale's Law**: Separate excitatory/inhibitory populations
2. **Metabolic Efficiency**: Sparse coding to minimize energy
3. **Structural Connectivity**: Small-world topology with hub nodes
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Respect theta (4-8Hz) and gamma (30-80Hz) rhythms
5. **Synaptic Homeostasis**: Prevent runaway excitation via normalization

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Development**:
  1. Start with simple Hopfield network for CA3
  2. Add DG pattern separation
  3. Integrate System 2 reasoning
  4. Implement consolidation dynamics
  
- **Biological Validation**:
  - Consult neuroscience literature for parameter ranges
  - Validate against known behavioral phenomena
  - Use existing hippocampal models as reference
  
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Use sparse matrix operations (nalgebra/sprs)
  - SIMD for embedding operations
  - Approximate nearest-neighbor for large-scale search
  
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Fallback to simple pattern matching if biological model fails
  - Confidence-weighted combination of multiple strategies
  - Feature flags for each biological component
