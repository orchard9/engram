- Phased rollout with comprehensive monitoring
- Extensive property-based testing
- Chaos engineering for durability validation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence
- All performance targets met or exceeded
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
- <5% error rates across all cognitive metrics
- Sub-millisecond P95 latencies for core operations

### Cognitive Fidelity
- Biologically-plausible neural dynamics
- Empirically-validated forgetting curves  
- Human-like pattern completion (>70% plausibility)
- Proper uncertainty propagation throughout

### Production Readiness

- Graceful degradation under all failure modes

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start each task** by reading its enhanced specification completely
2. **Implement incrementally** with continuous testing against acceptance criteria
3. **Use feature flags** for all new functionality during development
4. **Validate integration** with dependent tasks before marking complete
5. **Document decisions** that deviate from specifications with rationale
6. **Test edge cases** extensively, especially for concurrent operations

## Integration with Existing System

Milestone 1 enhances rather than replaces existing functionality:
- Maintains API compatibility with milestone 0
- Extends existing `MemoryStore`, `Episode`, `Cue` types
- Preserves graceful degradation principles
- Keeps cognitive error messaging patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Review** each task specification for technical accuracy
2. **Assign** tasks based on expertise and availability  
3. **Set up** monitoring and benchmarking infrastructure
4. **Begin implementation** with Task 001 (SIMD Vector Operations)
5. **Track progress** weekly against this critical path
