# Task 012: Integration Testing and Validation

**Status**: Pending
**Duration**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: All tasks
**Owner**: TBD

---

## Objective

End-to-end integration tests: Query → Parse → Execute → Result flow. Verify multi-tenant isolation, performance under load, no memory leaks.

---

## Files

`engram-core/tests/query_integration_test.rs`

---

## Test Scenarios

1. Parse → Execute → Result verification
2. Multi-tenant query isolation
3. Pattern completion integration (when M8 ready)
4. Performance: 1000 queries/sec sustained load
5. Memory leak detection: valgrind/miri

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified
- [ ] No memory leaks under sustained load
- [ ] P99 latency <5ms (parse + execute)
- [ ] Throughput >1000 queries/sec
