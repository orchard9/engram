# Task 011: Documentation and Examples

**Status**: Pending
**Duration**: 0.5 days
**Dependencies**: Task 009
**Owner**: TBD

---

## Objective

User-facing documentation: query language reference, examples for each operation, error catalog, performance characteristics.

---

## Files

1. `docs/reference/query-language.md` - Complete syntax reference
2. `examples/query_examples.rs` - Runnable examples
3. `docs/reference/error-catalog.md` - Error message reference

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Reference doc covers all syntax features
- [x] Examples compile and run
- [x] Error catalog shows actual error output
- [x] Performance characteristics documented

## Completion Notes

Documentation completed successfully:

1. **docs/reference/query-language.md**: Comprehensive 490-line reference covering all query operations with examples, performance characteristics, and grammar summary.

2. **engram-core/examples/query_examples.rs**: Runnable examples demonstrating all query types, builder patterns, and error handling. Compiles cleanly and runs successfully.

3. **docs/reference/error-catalog.md**: Complete error catalog with 750+ lines documenting all tokenization, parse, and validation errors with causes, fixes, and recovery strategies.

All documentation follows Julia Evans' style - clear, approachable, technically accurate.

## Commit Status

**BLOCKED**: Cannot commit due to pre-existing clippy warnings in engram-core/src/query/executor/query_executor.rs and related files from Tasks 006/007. Created Task 013 to track fixing these warnings.

The documentation files themselves have no issues and are ready for commit once the pre-existing warnings are resolved.
