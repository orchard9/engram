# Task 013: Fix Query Executor Clippy Warnings

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Duration**: 0.5 days
**Dependencies**: Tasks 006, 007
**Owner**: Claude Code with rust-graph-engine-architect agent
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Completed**: 2025-10-29
**Resolved By**: Commits b69b878 and ff45ede (milestone-16 Edition 2024 compatibility work)

## Objective

Fix clippy warnings in query executor code that block Task 011 from committing.

---

## Background

During Task 011 (Documentation and Examples), clippy warnings were discovered in the query executor code from Tasks 006 and 007. These warnings prevent the documentation task from being committed due to pre-commit hooks.

---

## Warnings to Fix

### In `engram-core/src/query/executor/query_executor.rs`:

1. **needless_pass_by_value**: Multiple query structs passed by value but not consumed
   - RecallQuery, PredictQuery, ImagineQuery, ConsolidateQuery parameters
   - Arc<SpaceHandle> parameter

2. **unused_self**: Several methods don't use `&self` and should be associated functions
   - execute_predict_query
   - execute_imagine_query
   - execute_consolidate_query
   - pattern_to_cue
   - create_query_evidence

3. **trivially_copy_pass_by_ref**: QueryExecutionError::as_str takes &self for 1-byte value

### In `engram-core/src/query/executor/recall.rs`:

1. **unwrap_used**: Multiple test cases use .unwrap()
   - test_apply_confidence_above_constraint
   - test_apply_confidence_below_constraint
   - test_apply_content_contains_constraint
   - test_apply_in_memory_space_constraint
   - test_apply_multiple_constraints

2. **redundant_clone**: Test data cloned unnecessarily in apply_constraints tests

### In `engram-core/src/query/executor/spread.rs`:

1. **float_cmp**: Strict equality checks on f32 values in tests
   - test_spread_query_defaults
   - test_spread_query_effective_values

---

## Files to Modify

- `engram-core/src/query/executor/query_executor.rs` (stub implementation)
- `engram-core/src/query/executor/recall.rs` (test code)
- `engram-core/src/query/executor/spread.rs` (test code)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All clippy warnings in query executor resolved
- [x] Tests still pass after fixes
- [x] `make quality` runs cleanly
- [x] No functional changes to executor behavior

---

## Completion Summary

All clippy warnings mentioned in this task were resolved during milestone-16 Edition 2024 compatibility improvements. The query executor code now passes clippy with zero warnings.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Test code patterns**: Added appropriate `#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]`, `#[allow(clippy::expect_used)]`, and `#[allow(clippy::float_cmp)]` to test modules
2. **Code structure**: Ensured proper use of `&self` vs static functions
3. **Ownership**: Verified parameters use references appropriately
4. **Edition 2024**: Fixed 60+ if-let chain instances across codebase

### Validation

- `cargo clippy --package engram-core --lib` passes with zero warnings
- All tests pass
- `make quality` clippy checks pass
- Zero clippy warnings in query executor code (query_executor.rs, recall.rs, spread.rs)

### Evidence

The warnings listed in this task were not found in the current codebase:
- needless_pass_by_value - Code uses references properly
- unused_self - Methods correctly use self or are static/associated functions
- trivially_copy_pass_by_ref - Not found
- unwrap_used in tests - Already allowed via `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]`
- redundant_clone - Not found (no unnecessary clones)
- float_cmp - Already allowed in tests via `#[allow(clippy::float_cmp)]`

---

## Notes

- These warnings were introduced in Tasks 006 (RECALL) and 007 (SPREAD)
- They were blocking Task 011 from committing via pre-commit hooks
- Resolved automatically during milestone-16 comprehensive quality improvements
- Priority: High (blocks documentation commit) - RESOLVED
