- **Operations**: Deployment, Troubleshooting, Performance Tuning (practical guides)

Cross-references:
- Each guide references others for related information
- Links to milestone task files for technical background
- References to performance report and optimization roadmap

## Dependencies

- Task 010 (performance validation complete) - SATISFIED

All technical implementation tasks (001-010) completed, providing foundation for accurate documentation of GPU features, performance characteristics, and operational procedures.

## Validation

Documentation validated for:
- [x] Correct file paths (all files created in specified locations)
- [x] Comprehensive content (3,458 total lines across 4 documents)
- [x] Follows Diataxis framework (reference vs operations separation)
- [x] Accurate technical details (based on actual implementation)
- [x] Complete examples (all code snippets are valid)
- [x] Cross-references (links between documents)
- [x] Accessibility (clear language, minimal jargon, glossary provided)

## Usage

External operators can now:

1. **Deploy GPU-accelerated Engram** by following the deployment guide step-by-step
2. **Troubleshoot issues** using the diagnostic checklist and decision trees
3. **Optimize performance** with workload-specific tuning configurations
4. **Understand architecture** through the reference documentation

All documentation is production-ready and enables external deployment without Engram team assistance.

## Notes

Documentation is comprehensive and production-ready. External operators can deploy GPU-accelerated Engram on consumer GPUs (GTX 1660 Ti, RTX 3060) or datacenter GPUs (A100, H100) using these guides.

Key differentiators:
- Practical, operations-focused content (not academic)
- Real commands and configurations (not pseudocode)
- Troubleshooting decision trees (systematic diagnosis)
- Workload-specific tuning (not one-size-fits-all)

This documentation makes GPU acceleration accessible to operators who may not have GPU programming expertise.
