# Task 009: Memory Pressure and OOM Handling

**Status**: Pending
**Estimated Duration**: 2 days
**Priority**: High (prevents production crashes)
**Owner**: Reliability Engineer

## Objective

Ensure robust GPU operation under VRAM constraints through batch size adaptation, OOM recovery, and automatic CPU fallback.

## Deliverables

1. Batch size adaptation based on available VRAM
2. OOM recovery via automatic CPU fallback
3. Memory pressure monitoring and telemetry
4. Graceful degradation under constrained resources

## Technical Specification

See MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md "OOM Prevention" section for:
- Batch size adaptation algorithm
- Memory pressure monitoring
- Graceful degradation strategy

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Never crashes due to OOM (always falls back to CPU)
- [ ] Automatically splits large batches when VRAM insufficient
- [ ] Monitors and reports VRAM usage to metrics
- [ ] Works correctly on GPUs with 4GB, 8GB, 24GB VRAM

## Dependencies

- Task 007 (hybrid executor) - BLOCKING
