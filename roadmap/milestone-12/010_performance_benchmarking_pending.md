# Task 010: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization

**Status**: Pending
**Estimated Duration**: 2 days
**Priority**: High (validates performance targets)
**Owner**: Performance Engineer

## Objective

Validate GPU acceleration achieves target speedups through comprehensive benchmarking against CPU SIMD and comparison with industry-standard GPU libraries.

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive benchmark suite vs CPU SIMD
2. Comparison against FAISS GPU and cuBLAS
3. Performance report with speedup analysis
4. Optimization recommendations for future work

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Achieves >3x speedup over CPU SIMD for target operations
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds FAISS GPU for similarity search
- [ ] Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Provides baseline for performance regression detection

## Dependencies

- Tasks 003, 005, 006 (all kernels operational) - BLOCKING
- Tasks 008, 009 (correctness validated) - BLOCKING
