# Milestone 12: GPU Acceleration

**Status**: Pending
**Duration**: 16-20 days
**Priority**: High

## Overview

This milestone adds production-grade CUDA GPU acceleration to Engram's memory operations while maintaining strict CPU-only compatibility. GPU acceleration is pragmatic and data-driven: only operations with profiling-proven speedup >3x are accelerated, with automatic CPU fallback when GPUs are unavailable or unsuitable.

## Key Principles

1. **CPU-First Design**: Every GPU operation has an identical CPU SIMD fallback
2. **Zero-Copy Where Possible**: Use CUDA Unified Memory to eliminate explicit transfers
3. **Conservative Memory Management**: Prevent OOM through batch size adaptation
4. **Graceful Degradation**: GPU unavailability reduces throughput, not functionality
5. **Production-Ready**: Works on consumer GPUs (GTX 1660) through datacenter (A100/H100)

## Key Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Floating-Point Determinism

### Risk 4: Multi-Tenant GPU Contention

## Out of Scope (Future Milestones)

The following are explicitly deferred:

1. **Multi-GPU Support**: Data parallelism across multiple GPUs
2. **Tensor Core Optimization**: FP16/BF16 mixed precision
3. **Custom Memory Allocator**: Specialized GPU memory management
4. **Persistent Kernels**: Resident kernels to eliminate launch overhead
5. **CUDA Graphs**: Pre-recorded kernel launch sequences
6. **ROCm Support**: AMD GPU compatibility
7. **Distributed GPU**: GPU acceleration across multiple nodes

These require single-GPU acceleration to be proven in production first.

## Files Created

### Documentation
- `MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` - Comprehensive technical specification
- `README.md` - This overview document
- Task files: `001_*_pending.md` through `012_*_pending.md`

### Code (To Be Created During Implementation)
- `engram-core/build.rs` - CUDA compilation integration
- `engram-core/src/compute/cuda/` - GPU acceleration module
- `engram-core/cuda/kernels/` - CUDA kernel implementations
- `engram-core/benches/gpu_*` - GPU performance benchmarks
- `engram-core/tests/gpu_*` - GPU correctness tests

## Getting Started

### For Implementers

1. **Read the Implementation Spec**: `MILESTONE_12_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` contains all technical details
2. **Start with Task 001**: Profiling establishes baseline and priorities
3. **Set up CUDA Environment**: Task 002 must work before any kernel development
4. **Follow Critical Path**: Dependencies are clearly marked in each task file

### For Reviewers

1. **Verify Correctness First**: CPU-GPU equivalence is non-negotiable
2. **Validate Performance**: Compare benchmarks against targets
3. **Test Fallback Paths**: GPU failures must not break functionality
4. **Check Documentation**: External operators must be able to deploy

### For Operators

1. **GPU is Optional**: Engram works identically without GPU, just slower
2. **CUDA 11.0+ Required**: Older CUDA versions not supported
3. **Consumer GPUs Supported**: GTX 1660+ provides meaningful acceleration
4. **Monitor GPU Metrics**: Track OOM events and fallback rates

## Success Definition

Milestone 12 is successful when:

1. **Performance**: GPU acceleration provides >3x speedup on target operations
2. **Robustness**: No crashes, graceful fallback, works on diverse hardware
3. **Transparency**: Users unaware whether CPU or GPU is executing their operations
4. **Production-Ready**: Deployed in production with monitoring and observability

This is NOT an academic exercise - this is production infrastructure that must be reliable, fast, and maintainable.
