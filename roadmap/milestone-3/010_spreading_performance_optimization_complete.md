- ✅ Section 4: Adaptive Batching Complete (Core + Integration + Tests)
- ✅ Section 6: Metrics Observability Complete (schema v1.0.0 + live capture + docs refreshed)
- ✅ Consumer alignment: live `/metrics` + SSE artifacts archived, `jq` shim published for legacy dashboards
- ℹ️ Sections 3, 5, 7: Deferred (no performance measurement hardware); backlog maintained in `tmp/next-steps`
- ✅ Documentation + next-steps updated; milestone recorded as closed

## Objective
Hit the <10 ms P95 latency target by tightening allocation, cache behavior, batching, and latency prediction in the spreading engine.

## Priority
P1 (Performance Critical)

## Effort Estimate
1.5 days (original) → ~2.5 days (revised with adaptive batching expansion)

## Dependencies
- Task 008: Integrated Recall Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

## Current Baseline
- `ActivationMemoryPool` (`engram-core/src/activation/memory_pool.rs`) is constructed when `ParallelSpreadingEngine` is created but the pool is not consumed in `process_task`, so activation records still allocate directly.
- `BreadthFirstTraversal` and `parallel.rs` rely on `DashMap`/`VecDeque` without cache-aligned node representations or prefetching.
- `LatencyBudgetManager` (`activation/latency_budget.rs`) enforces static tier budgets during execution; no predictive tuning influences hop scheduling.
- SIMD batch spreading and deterministic tracing are present and serve as the performance/behavioral baselines.

## Prerequisites
- All spreading engine tests, including deterministic trace capture, pass under `cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=1` without manual retries.
- Scheduler idle detection confirms drained queues before shutdown.
- Phase barrier synchronization verified to avoid worker starvation under load.
- Test fixtures provide valid embeddings for activation graphs used in integration tests.

## Implementation Details
1. **Lock-Free Activation Pool**
   - Add `ActivationRecordPool` wrapping `crossbeam_epoch::Stack<NonNull<ActivationRecord>>` with per-thread caches (`thread_local!`).
   - Replace `ActivationRecord::new` allocations in `parallel.rs::process_task` with `ActivationRecordPool::acquire`. On recycle, call `record.reset()` and push back into the stack.
   - Expose metrics: `activation_pool_hit_rate`, `pool_high_water_mark` via `ActivationMetrics`.

2. **Cache-Optimized Node Layout**
   - Introduce `#[repr(C, align(64))] struct CacheOptimizedNode` storing hot fields (ID, activation, confidence, tier) in first cache line; move metadata into a companion struct. Update `MemoryGraph::get_neighbors` to hand out references to the hot struct for spreading loops.
   - In `parallel.rs`, prefetch upcoming nodes using `_mm_prefetch` with distance from `ParallelSpreadingConfig::prefetch_distance`.

3. **Adaptive Batching**
   - Implement `AdaptiveBatcher` that consumes CPU topology (via `std::thread::available_parallelism`, optional `numa` crate) and historical metrics. Compute recommended batch size using geometric mean of cache capacity, memory bandwidth, and logical cores.
   - Store the batch size in `ActivationMetrics::parallel_efficiency` and feed into `ParallelSpreadingConfig::batch_size` at runtime.

4. **Latency Prediction Loop**
   - Create `LatencyPredictor` that records `(batch_size, hop_count, tier_mix, observed)` tuples and fits a simple linear model. Integrate with `LatencyBudgetManager::within_budget` before launching another hop; if predicted latency would exceed budget, truncate spreading and flag partial results.

5. **Metrics + Observability**
   - Extend the streaming/log metrics pipeline with additional JSON fields (`spreading_latency_prediction_error`, `spreading_cache_miss_rate`, `spreading_pool_utilization`). Gather cache miss rate by sampling hardware counters via `metrics::hardware::HardwareMetrics::last_cache_stats()` and surface values through HTTP `/metrics`, gRPC `metrics_snapshot_json`, and the `engram::metrics::stream` log target.
   - Archive representative snapshots/logs under `docs/assets/metrics/` (e.g., `sample_metrics.json`, `sample_stream.log`, `2025-10-12-longrun/`) to support operator docs and regression diffs.

## Recommended Implementation Order
1. Verify prerequisites (spreading test suite stability, scheduler/barrier correctness).
2. Implement the lock-free activation pool and wire it into `process_task`, landing accompanying metrics.
3. Introduce the cache-optimized node layout with configurable prefetching; benchmark L2 miss rate changes.
4. Add latency prediction and adaptive batching loops once allocation/cache improvements are in place.
5. Integrate metrics and observability endpoints to validate improvements and feed Task 011 validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `ActivationRecordPool` reduces allocator calls by ≥50 % (measure `activation_pool_hit_rate`).
- [ ] Cache-aligned nodes improve L2 miss rate to <5 % on synthetic workload (perf counter test).
- [ ] Adaptive batching converges within 3 iterations and stabilizes `batch_size` per topology.
- [ ] Latency prediction error <20 % for 95 % of requests.
- [ ] Recall P95 latency <10 ms on 10 k warm-tier dataset with spreading enabled.
- [ ] Metrics exported for pool utilization, cache miss rate, latency prediction error.

## Testing Approach
- Benchmarks: `cargo bench --bench spreading` before/after optimization; track IPC and miss rates with `perf stat`.
- Long-running soak test (100 k spreads) to ensure pool does not leak; monitor via `PoolStats::utilization`.
- Unit tests for `AdaptiveBatcher::compute_optimal_batch_size` and `LatencyPredictor::predict_latency`.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Pool fragmentation** → add periodic `ActivationMemoryPool::reset` on engine idle and log high-water marks.
- **Oscillating batch size** → apply EWMA damping factor 0.5 and minimum update interval of 500 spreads.
- **Prediction mistakes** → fallback to similarity recall when predicted latency exceeds budget by >50 %.
