## Dependencies
- Task 011: Comprehensive Spreading Validation

## Technical Approach

### Streaming Telemetry
- Instrument the existing streaming pipeline in `engram-core/src/metrics/mod.rs` instead of Prometheus-only hooks. Add spreading metric constants (for example `SPREADING_LATENCY_HOT`, `SPREADING_FAILURES_TOTAL`, `SPREADING_BREAKER_STATE`) and wire them through `MetricsRegistry::{increment_counter, observe_histogram, record_gauge}` so they feed the `StreamingAggregator`.
- Extend `SpreadingMetrics` in `engram-core/src/activation/mod.rs` with helpers such as `record_activation_latency`, `record_cycle`, `record_gpu_event`, and `record_pool_snapshot_streaming`. Each helper updates the local atomics and immediately pushes a streaming update with the tier encoded in the metric name (`spreading_latency_hot_seconds`, `spreading_latency_warm_seconds`, etc.).
- Update the worker hot path in `engram-core/src/activation/parallel.rs` to call the helpers after each activation task. Use the existing `tier` value to pick the histogram suffix, emit latency observations in seconds, increment total spread counters, and record latency budget violations via `MetricsRegistry::increment_counter`.
- Track GPU launches/fallbacks inside `engram-core/src/activation/gpu_interface.rs` (when `AdaptiveSpreadingEngine` falls back to CPU) and record similarity fallbacks in `engram-core/src/activation/recall.rs` so every recovery path increments `spreading_fallback_total`.
- Add a `spreading` section to the payload returned by `MetricsRegistry::streaming_snapshot()` with aggregated latency percentiles, breaker state, fallback totals, and pool utilisation so the CLI can expose the data without bespoke Prometheus exporters.

### Health & Readiness Probes
- Refactor `engram-core/src/metrics/health.rs` to support pluggable probes. Introduce a `HealthProbe` trait that returns a typed `HealthCheckResult`, store probes in the registry with hysteresis settings, and persist last-success/last-failure metadata.
- Implement `SpreadingHealthProbe` in a new `engram-core/src/activation/health_checks.rs`. Cache a synthetic five-node cycle graph (reuse helpers from `activation::test_support`), run `ParallelSpreadingEngine::spread_activation`, and fail if activation mass is zero or latency exceeds 50 ms. Record probe latency through the streaming telemetry helpers.
- Register the probe during `metrics::init()` and expose accessor APIs (for example `SystemHealth::check_named("spreading")`, `SystemHealth::latest_report()`) so callers can obtain structured results.
- Update `engram-cli/src/api.rs`: add `GET /health/spreading` that returns the most recent probe state plus latency budget info, and extend `/api/v1/system/health` to include every probe’s status, consecutive failure counts, and timestamps. Start a background `tokio::time::interval(Duration::from_secs(10))` task in server bootstrap that runs the probe and caches its result for the HTTP handlers.

### Circuit Breaker
- Create `engram-core/src/activation/circuit_breaker.rs` using a three-state machine (Closed/Open/HalfOpen) backed by `AtomicU64` counters and a ring buffer of the last 50 spread outcomes. Treat spreading errors, activation mass below threshold, or latency >1.5× budget as failures.
- Embed the breaker within `CognitiveRecall` (store it in the builder and clone into each instance). Before invoking spreading, call `breaker.should_attempt()`; if it returns false, immediately invoke `fallback_to_similarity`, increment `spreading_breaker_open_total`, and log a warning with the breaker state.
- On every recall completion invoke `breaker.on_result(success, latency)`. When the breaker transitions states, emit structured logs (`tracing::info!(state, reason, ...)`) and update a streaming gauge `spreading_breaker_state` so dashboards can visualise openness over time.

### Auto-Tuning
- Add `engram-core/src/activation/auto_tuning.rs` with a `SpreadingAutoTuner` that consumes `SpreadingMetricsSnapshot` plus tier summaries. Use EWMA of latency and hop count to recommend adjustments to `ParallelSpreadingConfig` (batch size, tier timeouts, max depth) subject to guardrails (batch size 8–128, hop limit 2–6, timeout multipliers 0.5×–2×).
- Wrap the spreading config in `Arc<RwLock<ParallelSpreadingConfig>>` so the tuner can apply updates safely. Provide `apply_recommendation` that writes through to the engine (add `ParallelSpreadingEngine::update_config(&ParallelSpreadingConfig)` to propagate changes to the scheduler and latency budgets).
- Spawn a background task in `engram-cli/src/main.rs` that every five minutes pulls `metrics.streaming_snapshot()`, feeds the tuner, applies any recommendation exceeding the 10 % improvement threshold, and appends a structured audit entry. Record adjustments in a bounded log and expose them through `GET /api/v1/system/spreading/config`.
- Emit a counter `spreading_autotune_changes_total` and attach previous/new values to the audit log via `tracing::info!(old = ?config, new = ?updated)`.

### Dashboards & Alerts
- Publish a Grafana dashboard at `docs/operations/spreading_dashboard.json` charting latency p50/p95/p99, breaker state, fallback rate, GPU fallback count, and activation-pool utilisation using the streaming metric names.
- Add Prometheus adapter assets under `deploy/observability/prometheus/spreading.rules.yaml` with recording rules for five-minute failure rate, latency SLO burn, and breaker openness; document how to feed the streaming JSON into Prometheus (or convert via the existing log/stream bridge).
- Update operational docs (`docs/operations/spreading.md`) with runbook steps: how to check `/health/spreading`, how to interpret breaker transitions, how to override auto-tuner guardrails, and where the audit log lives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `MetricsRegistry::streaming_snapshot()` (and `/api/v1/system/metrics/spreading`) shows per-tier latency histograms, fallback totals, breaker state, and pool utilisation derived from live spreading runs.
- [ ] `/health/spreading` readiness endpoint fails within 30 s when spreading latency breaches the 50 ms target or activation mass drops to zero, and `/api/v1/system/health` surfaces the degraded status with reason text.
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents spreading once failure rate >5 % or latency budget is breached, logs state transitions, increments `spreading_breaker_open_total`, and automated tests cover Closed→Open→HalfOpen→Closed transitions.
- [ ] Auto-tuner applies configuration updates only when the predicted improvement >10 %, records each change in the audit log, updates the shared config, and exposes adjustments via the CLI endpoint.
- [ ] Grafana dashboard JSON, Prometheus recording/alert rules, and operations doc updates are committed with references to the new metric names.
- [ ] Chaos test (latency injector) demonstrates alert firing, breaker opening, and autotuner backoff with results captured in `docs/operations/spreading.md`.

## Testing Approach
- Add unit tests for `SpreadingHealthProbe` covering success/failure paths and hysteresis using `tokio::time::pause` to advance the readiness loop.
- Extend `engram-core` tests to simulate breaker thresholds and verify fallback/hysteresis behaviour; include property tests for auto-tuner guardrails and configuration clamping.
- Add integration tests under `engram-cli/tests/` verifying `/health/spreading`, `/api/v1/system/health`, and `/api/v1/system/metrics/spreading` responses using the streaming snapshot.
- Build a chaos harness (`scripts/fuzz_spreading_latency.rs`) that injects artificial latency/failures into the spreading engine, asserting that metrics, alerts, and breaker/autotuner reactions match expectations.
- Ensure streaming metrics tests assert that new metric names appear in `AggregatedMetrics` windows with correct counts and latency buckets.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Telemetry overhead** → reuse the ArrayQueue streaming aggregator, cap metric names to avoid cardinality explosions, and sample latency at 1/10 once queue depth exceeds 32 k (log drops via `ExportStats`).
- **Circuit breaker flapping** → track last transition timestamps, enforce a 30 s cool-down, limit HalfOpen probes to five, and expose a manual override flag in the CLI config endpoint.
- **Auto-tuner oscillation** → enforce guardrails, require a >10 % improvement estimate, debounce updates to five-minute intervals, and allow operators to disable the background loop with a CLI flag.
- **Health probe load** → cache the synthetic graph and reuse the spreading engine so readiness checks stay under 2 % CPU and avoid allocating per run.
