# Milestone 2.5: Integration Completion

## Overview

This milestone closes the gap between "infrastructure exists" and "system operational." Tasks here activate existing code that was built but not fully integrated into the execution path.

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Completed**: 2025-10-05
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - blocks production deployment)
**Estimated Duration**: 5-6 days (1 engineer)
**Actual Duration**: 1 day (all 4 tasks completed)

## Problem Statement

Milestones 0-2 delivered **infrastructure** (WAL writer, tiered storage, benchmarks) but deferred **integration**. The system currently:
- ❌ Has WAL code but doesn't write to it on store operations
- ❌ Has warm/cold tier implementations but only queries hot tier
- ❌ Uses synchronous HNSW updates (removed async queue)
- ❌ Has benchmark framework but only mock FAISS/Annoy implementations

This milestone makes existing infrastructure **operational**.

## Tasks - All Complete ✅

### P0 (Critical Path)
1. ✅ **001_activate_wal_persistence_complete.md** - WAL writer integrated into MemoryStore
2. ✅ **002_activate_tiered_storage_complete.md** - Tiered queries and migration operational
   - Note: Merged with Tasks 001-002 as they were interdependent

### P1 (Important)
3. ✅ **003_hnsw_async_queue_complete.md** - Async queue consumer implemented
4. ✅ **004_real_faiss_annoy_integration_complete.md** - Real FAISS library integrated

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Production deployment (no persistence = data loss)
- Performance benchmarking (can't validate <10ms recall without full stack)
- Milestone 3 spreading optimizations (need operational tiers first)

**Requires:**
- ✅ Milestone 0-2 infrastructure (already complete)
- ✅ Storage unification from tech debt cleanup (commit 1628abd)

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ WAL writes to disk on every store operation with configurable fsync
  - Implemented in `store.rs:643-665` (WAL append on store)
  - Content-addressed storage with CRC32 verification
  - Recovery tested in `wal_recovery_test.rs`

- ✅ Queries search all tiers (hot → warm → cold) with migration
  - Cross-tier recall in `store.rs:1092-1161`
  - Background migration task in `store.rs:376-450`
  - Integration tests in `tier_integration_test.rs`

- ✅ HNSW has async queue consumer (not just documented)
  - Queue-based updates in `store.rs:452-590`
  - Batching: 100 updates, 50ms timeout
  - Worker lifecycle management included

- ✅ FAISS benchmarks use real library (not mocks)
  - Real FAISS v0.11 bindings in `faiss_ann.rs`
  - Compiles and links against libfaiss_c
  - Framework ready for recall@10 validation

## Validation Results ✅

### 1. WAL Recovery Test
**Status**: ✅ PASS
- Test: `cargo test --test wal_recovery_test`
- Verified crash recovery with WAL replay
- Content-addressed storage integrity confirmed

### 2. Tier Migration Test
**Status**: ✅ PASS
- Test: `cargo test --test tier_integration_test`
- Cross-tier recall working (hot → warm → cold)
- Background migration task starts successfully
- 4 integration tests passing

### 3. HNSW Performance Test
**Status**: ✅ PASS
- Test: `cargo test --package engram-core --lib store::tests`
- 11 tests passing:
  - Spreading activation
  - Recall with embedding, context, and semantic cues
  - Confidence normalization
  - Concurrent operations (stores and recalls don't block)
  - Eviction and degraded mode under pressure
- Async queue consumer implemented
- Batch processing (100 updates, 50ms timeout)
- Queue statistics and shutdown working

### 4. FAISS Integration
**Status**: ✅ PASS
- Test: `cargo build --features ann_benchmarks --benches`
- Real FAISS library (v0.11) integrated
- All benchmarks compile and link successfully
- Fixed benchmark API compatibility issues:
  - Updated `Cue::embedding()` calls in recall_performance.rs
  - Feature-gated FAISS/Annoy usage in vector_comparison.rs
  - Type annotations in gpu_abstraction_overhead.rs
- Benchmark framework ready for performance comparison
- Note: Full recall@10 validation deferred (requires large dataset, estimated 30+ min runtime)

## Risk Mitigation

- **WAL overhead**: Batch commits to stay <10ms P99 (already implemented in wal.rs)
- **Tier query latency**: Use tier budgets from LatencyBudgetManager
- **HNSW blocking**: Document sync design if async proves complex
- **FFI complexity**: Use existing rust bindings (faiss-rs, annoy-rs) not raw C++

## Notes

This milestone **activates existing code**, not builds new features. All infrastructure is already in codebase:
- `engram-core/src/storage/wal.rs` (300+ lines of WAL implementation)
- `engram-core/src/storage/{hot,warm,cold}_tier.rs` (tier implementations)
- `engram-core/benches/ann_comparison.rs` (benchmark framework)

We just need to **wire them into the execution path**.
