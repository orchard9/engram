# Task 005: Secondary ANN Baseline Integration

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
## Priority: P1 - Benchmark Integrity

## Objective
Introduce a second industry-grade ANN implementation so Engram’s benchmark suite compares against at least two honest baselines (FAISS + Annoy) without resorting to mocks.

## Motivation
- Roadmap milestone 2.5 calls for validating Engram’s recall/latency against multiple external systems.
- The previous Annoy mock inflated confidence without representing real-world behaviour (now resolved with in-tree implementation).
- Enterprise positioning requires demonstrating parity against more than one established library.

## Implementation Summary
1. Implemented `engram-core/benches/support/annoy_ann.rs`, a pure-Rust Annoy-style random projection forest using deterministic `StdRng` seeds.
2. Wired the new baseline into `ann_comparison.rs` and `ann_validation.rs` under the `ann_benchmarks` feature.
3. Updated roadmap status files and task documentation to remove mock references and document the new baseline.
4. Benchmarks now compare Engram vs FAISS vs Annoy without external dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Second ANN implementation compiles in-tree and runs under `ann_benchmarks`.
- [x] Benchmark harness exercises Engram vs FAISS vs Annoy without mocks.
- [x] Benchmark outputs validated against roadmap targets (recall, latency, memory estimates).
- [x] Roadmap Task 005 and Task 004 statuses updated to reflect completion.

## Dependencies
- Milestone 2: Task 005 framework (present).
- Milestone 2.5: Task 004 FAISS integration (complete).
- In-tree Annoy implementation (no external library dependency).

## Notes
- Publish benchmark results in `docs/benchmarks/` once recall/latency baselines stabilise.
