# Task 014 Documentation Review Report

**Reviewer:** Technical Communication Lead (Julia Evans mode)
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Task File:** `/roadmap/milestone-13/014_documentation_operational_runbook_pending.md`
**Status:** NEEDS ENHANCEMENT

---

## Executive Summary

The documentation task file is **well-structured but incomplete** for ensuring developer success. While it provides excellent templates and clear deliverables, it lacks critical implementation guidance that will prevent common documentation pitfalls:

1. Missing concrete code examples that demonstrate real API usage
2. Insufficient guidance on translating psychology research into developer-friendly explanations
3. No validation checklist for ensuring examples actually compile
4. Operations guide needs failure mode scenarios based on actual system behavior

**Recommendation:** ENHANCE task file before marking as ready for implementation.

## Documentation Quality Assessment

### 1. API Reference (`docs/reference/cognitive_patterns.md`)

**Current Status:** Template provided ✓
**Quality Assessment:** NEEDS WORK

**What's Good:**
- Clear section structure (Priming, Interference, Reconsolidation)
- Performance characteristics mentioned (<10μs per operation)
- Parameter descriptions with empirical justification

**What's Missing:**

#### A. Concrete Code Examples
The template shows API names but no actual usage. Developers need to see:

```rust
// What we have now (template):
// - API: `SemanticPrimingEngine`
// - Parameters: `priming_strength`, `decay_half_life`, `similarity_threshold`

// What developers actually need:
use engram_core::cognitive::priming::SemanticPrimingEngine;
use engram_core::{Episode, MemoryGraph};

let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::new();
let mut graph = MemoryGraph::new();

// Store related episodes
let doctor = Episode::from_text("Dr. Smith examined the patient");
let nurse = Episode::from_text("Nurse Williams prepared the medication");
graph.add_episode(doctor.clone());
graph.add_episode(nurse.clone());

// When "doctor" is recalled, "nurse" gets primed
priming.activate_priming(&doctor, &graph);

// Check if "nurse" received priming boost
let boost = priming.compute_priming_boost(nurse.node_id());
println!("Nurse priming boost: {:.2}%", boost * 100.0);
```

**Why This Matters:**
Developers coming from traditional databases need to see "Here's how you actually use this thing" before they can understand "Here's why it works this way."

#### B. Integration Examples
Show how cognitive patterns work together:

```rust
// Real-world scenario: Building a medical knowledge system
let engine = MemoryEngine::new()
    .with_semantic_priming(true)
    .with_interference_detection(true);

// Store multiple similar episodes (creates interference)
engine.store(Episode::from_text("Patient A: hypertension, prescribed beta blockers"));
engine.store(Episode::from_text("Patient B: hypertension, prescribed ACE inhibitors"));
engine.store(Episode::from_text("Patient C: hypertension, prescribed beta blockers"));

// Query - interference detection triggers automatically
let results = engine.recall("patient with hypertension treatment");

// Results include interference metadata
for result in results {
    if let Some(interference) = result.interference_metadata() {
        println!("Warning: {} similar memories may interfere",
                 interference.similar_count);
    }
}
```

#### C. Parameter Tuning Guide
Developers need decision trees, not just parameter lists:

```
When to adjust priming_strength:
- DEFAULT (0.15): Medical terminology, technical concepts
- LOWER (0.08-0.12): Distinct concepts that shouldn't cross-prime
  Example: "Apple (fruit)" vs "Apple (company)"
- HIGHER (0.18-0.22): Highly associative domains
  Example: Musical concepts (melody → harmony → rhythm)

How to know if it's wrong:
- Too high: Unrelated concepts recall together (check recall precision)
- Too low: Related concepts don't benefit from priming (check recall latency)
```

**RECOMMENDATION for Task File:**
Add requirement: "Every API must have 2-3 working examples: basic usage, integration scenario, and parameter tuning."

---

### 2. Psychology Foundations (`docs/explanation/psychology_foundations.md`)

**Current Status:** Template provided ✓
**Quality Assessment:** NEEDS CLARITY GUIDANCE

**What's Good:**
- Clear academic citations (15 papers)
- Validation results with target ranges
- Biological plausibility section

**What's Missing:**

#### A. Analogy Development Guidelines
The task file doesn't guide how to explain complex psychology concepts. Here's what's needed:

**Example Enhancement:**

```markdown
## From Research to Code: Semantic Priming

### The Psychology (Neely 1977)
When people see "doctor," they respond faster to "nurse" (~50ms faster) than to
unrelated words like "car." This happens because related concepts share activation
in semantic memory.

### The Analogy
Think of your brain like a neighborhood where related concepts live next door:
- When you turn on lights at "doctor's house," the glow spills over to "nurse's house"
- Distant houses like "car" stay dark
- The glow fades over time (decay_half_life = 500ms in our model)

### The Implementation
We model this as activation spreading through an embedding space:
```rust
// Semantic similarity in embedding space = "living in same neighborhood"
let similarity = cosine_distance(doctor_embedding, nurse_embedding);

// Only neighbors (similarity > 0.6) get primed
if similarity > semantic_similarity_threshold {
    let boost = priming_strength * similarity; // Closer = more glow
    active_primes.insert(neighbor_id, boost);
}
```

### Why These Numbers?
- `priming_strength = 0.15`: Neely found 10-20% RT reduction → 15% boost
- `decay_half_life = 500ms`: Neely's SOA experiments showed effects at 400-600ms
- `similarity_threshold = 0.6`: Parameter sweep validation against DRM paradigm

### What This Means for Your Application
If you're building a recommendation system:
- Priming = "Users who viewed X often view Y"
- Decay = "Recency matters: recent views prime more strongly"
- Threshold = "Only recommend highly similar items"
```

**RECOMMENDATION for Task File:**
Add requirement: "For each cognitive pattern, include: (1) plain-English explanation, (2) real-world analogy, (3) code-to-psychology mapping, (4) parameter justification."

#### B. Validation Results Context
The template shows target ranges but doesn't explain what they mean:

```markdown
Current:
### DRM Paradigm: 60% false recall (target: 55-65%)

Better:
### DRM Paradigm: False Memory Validation

**What We're Measuring:**
When people study word lists like "bed, rest, awake, tired..." they falsely
"remember" seeing the word "sleep" 60% of the time, even though it wasn't shown.

**Why This Matters for Engram:**
This validates our pattern completion system generates plausible false memories,
just like human memory. If Engram couldn't do this, it wouldn't be faithfully
modeling cognitive reconstruction.

**Our Results:**
- Target: 55-65% false recall (Roediger & McDermott 1995)
- Achieved: 62% false recall (n=100 trials, p<0.05)
- Interpretation: Engram's semantic network density and consolidation parameters
  are calibrated to human-like associative strength

**What to Watch:**
- Too high (>75%): Pattern completion too aggressive, hallucination risk
- Too low (<45%): Semantic connections too weak, won't generalize well
```

**RECOMMENDATION for Task File:**
Add requirement: "For each validation result, explain: what we measured, why it matters, what the numbers mean, troubleshooting thresholds."

---

### 3. Operations Guide (`docs/operations/cognitive_metrics_tuning.md`)

**Current Status:** Template provided ✓
**Quality Assessment:** GOOD STRUCTURE, NEEDS REAL FAILURE MODES

**What's Good:**
- Clear metrics interpretation guidelines
- Expected ranges for each metric
- Performance tuning recommendations

**What's Missing:**

#### A. Failure Mode Scenarios
The template shows metrics but not actual problems:

```markdown
Current:
### Priming Event Rate
- Expected: 100-1000 events/sec
- High rate (>5000/sec): May indicate excessive spreading

Better:
### TROUBLESHOOTING: Priming Event Rate Spiking

**Symptom:** `engram_priming_events_total` counter jumping to 10K+/sec

**Why This Happens:**
Your similarity threshold (default 0.6) is too low for your embedding model,
causing nearly everything to prime everything else.

**How to Diagnose:**
```bash
# Check average similarity of primed pairs
curl localhost:9090/metrics | grep priming_similarity_histogram

# Expected: P50 around 0.70-0.80
# Problem: P50 below 0.65 means threshold too permissive
```

**How to Fix:**
```rust
// Option 1: Raise similarity threshold (most common fix)
let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .semantic_similarity_threshold(0.7)  // was 0.6
    .build();

// Option 2: Reduce max neighbors (if some nodes are highly connected)
let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .max_prime_neighbors(5)  // was 10
    .build();
```

**How to Validate Fix:**
Run for 5 minutes, check:
- Priming rate drops to 100-1000/sec ✓
- Recall latency P95 improves (less wasted priming) ✓
- Recall precision unchanged (still finding relevant items) ✓

**Prevention:**
During onboarding, run `engram-cli validate-embeddings` to check if your
embedding model produces well-separated clusters.
```

#### B. Runbook Format
Operations guides need step-by-step playbooks:

```markdown
## RUNBOOK: DRM False Recall Rate Out of Range

**Alert Trigger:** Weekly validation job reports false recall <45% or >75%

**Business Impact:**
- Too low: Pattern completion not generalizing, users get "I don't know" responses
- Too high: System hallucinating, users get plausible but wrong information

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Check if it's real data or test artifact**
   ```bash
   engram-cli validate drm --list-failures
   # Are failures on standard DRM lists or custom data?
   ```

2. **If standard lists failing: Consolidation issue**
   - Check: `engram_consolidation_events_total` (should be >0)
   - Check: `engram_pattern_strength_p95` (should be 0.6-0.8)
   - Fix: Review consolidation config from M6

3. **If custom lists: Embedding model mismatch**
   - Check: Average cosine similarity of "related" concepts
   - Expected: >0.7 for DRM-style semantic relations
   - Fix: Re-train embeddings or adjust similarity thresholds

4. **If widespread: Core bug, escalate**
   - Collect: Full validation logs, metrics snapshot, config
   - Rollback: Previous known-good version
   - File: Critical bug with reproduction steps

**Resolution Verification:**
Run full psychology validation suite (15 min):
```bash
cargo test --test psychology --release -- --nocapture
```
All DRM, spacing effect, and interference tests must pass.

**Post-Mortem:**
Document in `docs/operations/incidents/` with:
- What triggered incorrect behavior
- How monitoring detected it
- What fixed it
- How to prevent recurrence
```

**RECOMMENDATION for Task File:**
Add requirement: "For each 'common issue,' provide: symptom, diagnosis steps (with commands), fix options (with code), validation procedure, prevention."

---

### 4. Bibliography Validation

**Current Status:** Complete template provided ✓
**Quality Assessment:** EXCELLENT

**What's Good:**
- All 15 papers included
- APA formatting consistent
- Mix of classic and recent papers

**Minor Enhancement:**
Add accessibility notes for each citation:

```markdown
1. Anderson, J. R. (1974). Retrieval of propositional information from
   long-term memory. *Cognitive Psychology*, 6(4), 451-474.

   **Key Contribution:** Fan effect - retrieval time increases linearly with
   number of associations.

   **Relevance to Engram:** Validates our interference detection when nodes
   have high fan-out degree.

   **Access:** [DOI: 10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-1)
   (may require institutional access, see [Sci-Hub alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub))
```

**RECOMMENDATION for Task File:**
Add requirement: "For each citation, add: one-sentence summary, relevance to Engram, access information."

---

## Content Validation Checklist

**What's Missing from Task File:**
The task says "Code examples must compile and run" but doesn't specify HOW to validate this.

**Add to Implementation Checklist:**

```markdown
### Code Example Validation

- [ ] Create test harness for all API examples:
      ```bash
      cd docs/reference
      ./extract_examples.sh cognitive_patterns.md
      cargo test --doc -- cognitive_patterns
      ```

- [ ] Verify examples run in < 1 second:
      ```bash
      for example in examples/*.rs; do
          time cargo run --example $(basename $example .rs)
      done
      ```

- [ ] Test examples with minimal dependencies:
      ```rust
      // Each example should start with:
      use engram_core::prelude::*;  // ONE import, not scattered

      // And include expected output:
      // Expected output:
      // Nurse priming boost: 14.32%
      ```

- [ ] Validate parameters are actually defaults:
      ```bash
      grep -r "priming_strength: 0.15" engram-core/src/
      # If this returns 0 matches, doc is wrong!
      ```

- [ ] Check that troubleshooting commands work:
      ```bash
      # Run every curl/engram-cli command in operations guide
      # Collect any that return errors
      ./docs/operations/validate_commands.sh
      ```
```

---

## Target Audience Adaptations

---

## Missing Content Identification

### Critical Gaps in Template:

1. **No Integration Testing Section**
   ```markdown
   ## Integration Testing (ADD TO TASK)

   Before marking documentation complete:

   - [ ] Run all API examples against actual Engram instance
   - [ ] Verify operations commands work against live metrics
   - [ ] Test troubleshooting steps by deliberately breaking things
   - [ ] Validate parameters match actual code defaults
   - [ ] Check that cited papers are accessible (links work)
   ```

2. **No Versioning Strategy**
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Versioning (ADD TO TASK)

   - [ ] Document which Engram version these APIs are for
   - [ ] Mark deprecated parameters/APIs
   - [ ] Provide migration guides for breaking changes
   - [ ] Link to version-specific docs (not just "latest")
   ```

3. **No Feedback Mechanism**
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Feedback (ADD TO TASK)

   - [ ] Add "Was this helpful?" to each doc page
   - [ ] Include "Report an error" link with pre-filled GitHub issue
   - [ ] Track most-visited and least-visited pages
   - [ ] Review feedback monthly and update docs
   ```

---

## Recommended Improvements for Developer Experience

### 1. Interactive Examples

Instead of just static code:

```markdown
## Try It Now

Run this example in your terminal:
```bash
docker run -it engram-demo /examples/cognitive_priming.sh
```

Or try in our playground: [engram.io/playground/priming](https://engram.io/playground/priming)

Expected output:
```
Priming "doctor" → activating semantic neighbors...
  ✓ nurse (similarity: 0.82, boost: 12.3%)
  ✓ patient (similarity: 0.76, boost: 9.6%)
  ✓ hospital (similarity: 0.71, boost: 6.8%)
  ✗ car (similarity: 0.34, boost: 0.0%)
```
```

### 2. Visualization

For complex concepts like reconsolidation windows:

```markdown
## Reconsolidation Timeline Visualization

```
Memory Age:  0h      24h            1yr
             |-------|----------------|
             [New]   [Consolidated]   [Old]
                         ↓
             Recall triggers reconsolidation window
                         ↓
Time after   0h    1h     6h
recall:      |-----|------|
             [High plasticity → Low plasticity]

Modification allowed: YES    YES      NO (window closed)
Modification strength: 100%   50%      0%
```

Why this matters: In human memory, recently recalled items are temporarily
"unlocked" for modification. This is why therapy can update traumatic memories
during the reconsolidation window.
```

### 3. Decision Trees

For parameter tuning:

```markdown
## Parameter Tuning Decision Tree

Start here: Is your priming rate > 5000/sec?
│
├─ YES → Is recall precision < 0.7?
│   │
│   ├─ YES → Increase `semantic_similarity_threshold` to 0.7
│   │        (You're priming too broadly, degrading quality)
│   │
│   └─ NO → Increase `max_prime_neighbors` to 15
│            (Priming is working, you just have dense data)
│
└─ NO → Is recall latency P95 > 100ms?
    │
    ├─ YES → Decrease `decay_half_life` to 300ms
    │        (Primes lingering too long, bloating active set)
    │
    └─ NO → Your configuration is healthy! ✓
```

---

## Task File Enhancement Recommendations

### Add to "Deliverables" Section:

```markdown
### Must Have (ENHANCED)

- [ ] `/docs/reference/cognitive_patterns.md` with:
  - [ ] 15+ working code examples (tested via doc tests)
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks (actual measurements, not estimates)
  - [ ] Integration examples showing cognitive patterns working together
  - [ ] Parameter decision trees for tuning

- [ ] `/docs/explanation/psychology_foundations.md` with:
  - [ ] Plain-English + analogy for each cognitive pattern
  - [ ] Parameter derivation tables (empirical data → code values)
  - [ ] Validation result interpretation (what numbers mean)
  - [ ] Comparison to other cognitive architectures

- [ ] `/docs/operations/cognitive_metrics_tuning.md` with:
  - [ ] 5+ runbooks for common failure modes
  - [ ] Symptom-based troubleshooting navigation
  - [ ] Validation commands for each fix
  - [ ] Capacity planning guidelines
```

### Add New Section: "Quality Gates"

```markdown
## Quality Gates

Documentation CANNOT be marked complete until:

### Compilation Gate
```bash
# All API examples must compile and run
cd docs && ./validate_examples.sh
# Exit code 0 required
```

### Accuracy Gate
```bash
# All default parameters must match actual code
./scripts/validate_doc_parameters.sh
# Reports any mismatches between docs and implementation
```

### Accessibility Gate
```bash
# All citations must have working links or access notes
./scripts/validate_bibliography.sh
# Checks DOI links, suggests alternatives for paywalled papers
```

### Usability Gate
```bash
# Operations commands must work against live system
cd docs/operations && ./test_all_commands.sh
# Runs every curl/engram-cli command in the guide
```

### Completeness Gate
- [ ] Every public API has example
- [ ] Every metric has interpretation guide
- [ ] Every error message has troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Every parameter has tuning guidance
```

---

## Clarity and Accessibility Assessment

### What Makes Cognitive Concepts Accessible:

**GOOD Examples from Task:**
- ✓ Concrete parameter values with empirical justification
- ✓ Clear acceptance criteria with statistical bounds
- ✓ Performance characteristics

**NEEDS WORK:**
- More analogies bridging familiar to unfamiliar
- Progressive disclosure (simple → detailed)
- Visual aids for temporal phenomena (decay, windows)

### Recommended Explanation Pattern:

For each cognitive pattern:

```markdown
## [Pattern Name]

### The Everyday Experience (1 paragraph)
[Describe in terms everyone knows - forgetting, associations, etc.]

### The Psychology (1 paragraph)
[Cite research, explain phenomenon, mention key findings]

### The Implementation (code + explanation)
[Show how code maps to psychology, with specific line-by-line comments]

### The Parameters (decision table)
[When to adjust, what to watch, troubleshooting]

### The Validation (results + interpretation)
[What we measured, what it means, why it matters]
```

This structure ensures:
- Developers understand the "why" before the "how"
- Skeptics can verify academic grounding
- Operators know what to tune and why

---

## Final Recommendation

**ENHANCE TASK FILE with:**

1. **Code Example Requirements** (15+ working examples, tested)
2. **Analogy Development Guidelines** (bridge cognitive science to code)
3. **Runbook Format** (symptom → diagnosis → fix → validate)
4. **Quality Gates** (compilation, accuracy, accessibility, usability)
5. **Feedback Mechanisms** (how users report issues)

**THEN** mark task as ready for implementation.

**Estimated Additional Effort:** +0.5 days for enhancement implementation
**Benefit:** Documentation that developers actually use vs reference they avoid

---

## Appendix: Example Enhancement

Here's what one section should look like when fully enhanced:

```markdown
# Semantic Priming

## What You've Experienced

Ever notice how thinking about "breakfast" makes you think of "coffee," even
though no one mentioned coffee? That's semantic priming. Your brain
pre-activates related concepts, making them easier to recall.

## The Science (Collins & Loftus 1975, Neely 1977)

When humans see "doctor," they recognize "nurse" about 50ms faster than
unrelated words like "car." This happens because semantically related concepts
activate each other automatically, without conscious effort.

The effect:
- Peaks at 500ms after the prime
- Decays exponentially over 2-3 seconds
- Provides 10-20% retrieval speed improvement
- Works even when prime and target are in different languages

## How Engram Implements This

```rust
use engram_core::cognitive::priming::SemanticPrimingEngine;

// Create priming engine with empirically-validated defaults
let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::new();

// When user recalls "doctor"
let doctor = store.recall("doctor visits")?;

// Activate priming for semantically related concepts
priming.activate_priming(&doctor, &graph);
//     ↑
//     This spreads 15% activation boost to neighbors
//     with embedding similarity > 0.6

// Later, when recalling "nurse" (within 500ms)
let nurse_boost = priming.compute_priming_boost(nurse.node_id());
//                                               ↑
//     Returns 0.12 (12% boost) because:
//     1. "nurse" embedding is 0.82 similar to "doctor"
//     2. Only 200ms elapsed (decay is minimal)
//     3. boost = 0.15 * ((0.82 - 0.6) / (1.0 - 0.6))
//              = 0.15 * 0.55 = 0.082... normalized
```

### Why These Parameter Values?

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| `priming_strength` | 0.15 (15%) | Neely 1977: RT reduction was 10-20% for related primes |
| `decay_half_life` | 500ms | Neely 1977: SOA effects strongest at 400-600ms |
| `semantic_similarity_threshold` | 0.6 | Validated via DRM paradigm (Task 008): 60% false recall |

These aren't arbitrary! We ran parameter sweeps and picked values that
replicate published psychology experiments.

## When to Tune Parameters

### Priming Too Aggressive?
**Symptom:** Unrelated concepts appearing in recall results

```rust
// Reduce priming strength
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .priming_strength(0.10)  // down from 0.15
    .build()

// OR raise similarity threshold
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .semantic_similarity_threshold(0.70)  // up from 0.60
    .build()
```

### Priming Too Weak?
**Symptom:** Related concepts not benefiting from recent recalls

```rust
// Increase priming strength
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .priming_strength(0.20)  // up from 0.15
    .build()

// OR extend decay window
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .decay_half_life(Duration::from_millis(800))  // up from 500ms
    .build()
```

### How to Validate Changes

```bash
# Run DRM false memory validation
cargo test --test drm_paradigm -- --nocapture

# Expected: 55-65% false recall rate
# If outside range, your parameters broke cognitive realism
```

## Monitoring in Production

Key metrics to watch:

```prometheus
# Priming event rate (should be 100-1000/sec for typical workloads)
rate(engram_priming_events_total{type="semantic"}[1m])

# Average priming strength (should hover around 0.12-0.15)
engram_priming_strength_avg{type="semantic"}

# Priming hit rate (how often primed nodes are recalled)
engram_priming_hits_total / engram_priming_events_total
```

Alert if:
- Event rate > 5000/sec (too much priming, check threshold)
- Event rate < 10/sec (too little priming, check threshold)
- Hit rate < 0.05 (priming not helping, consider disabling)

## Full Working Example

```rust
use engram_core::prelude::*;
use engram_core::cognitive::priming::SemanticPrimingEngine;

This is what "accessible yet accurate" looks like. The task file should require
this level of completeness for every cognitive pattern.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Review this report with milestone lead
2. Enhance task file with recommendations
3. Assign to technical writer with psychology background
4. Budget 1.5 days instead of 1 day for implementation

---

**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Risk if Skipped:** Developers will struggle to use cognitive patterns correctly,
leading to support burden and potential misuse.
