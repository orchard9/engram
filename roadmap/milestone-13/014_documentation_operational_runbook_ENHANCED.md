# Task 014: Documentation and Operational Runbook (ENHANCED)

**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** P2
**Estimated Duration:** 1.5 days (was 1 day - increased for quality)
**Dependencies:** Task 013 (Integration Testing)
**Agent Review Required:** technical-communication-lead

## Overview

Create comprehensive documentation for cognitive patterns including API reference, biological foundations, and operational guides. Follows Diátaxis framework for public docs.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR:** Documentation must enable developers to successfully use cognitive patterns without deep psychology knowledge. Every code example must compile and demonstrate real usage.

## Enhanced Documentation Requirements

### Quality Principles

1. **Show, then explain** - Code examples before theory
2. **Bridge the gap** - Use analogies to connect familiar concepts to cognitive science
3. **Be actionable** - Every operations guide must have symptom → diagnosis → fix
4. **Validate everything** - All examples compile, all parameters match code, all commands work

---

## 1. API Reference (docs/reference/)

**File:** `/docs/reference/cognitive_patterns.md`

### Required Sections for Each Cognitive Module

#### A. Quick Start (< 10 lines of code)
Must demonstrate the simplest possible usage that produces visible results.

```rust
// Example template:
use engram_core::cognitive::priming::SemanticPrimingEngine;

let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::new();
priming.activate_priming(&recalled_episode, &graph);
let boost = priming.compute_priming_boost(node_id);
println!("Priming boost: {:.1}%", boost * 100.0);
```

#### B. Real-World Integration Examples (3-5 scenarios)

Must show cognitive patterns working together, not in isolation:

**Example 1: Medical Knowledge System**
```rust
// Building a system where recalling "doctor" primes "nurse"
// but also detects interference from similar patient cases
```

**Example 2: Recommendation Engine**
```rust
// Using priming for "users who viewed X often view Y"
// with reconsolidation for updating preferences
```

**Example 3: Educational Platform**
```rust
// Spacing effect for optimal review scheduling
// DRM-aware to detect false confidence in recall
```

#### C. Configuration Decision Trees

For each parameter, provide:
- Default value with empirical justification
- When to increase/decrease (with symptoms)
- How to validate changes (with test commands)

**Example:**
```
priming_strength:
├─ Default: 0.15 (15% boost)
│  Justification: Neely 1977 found 10-20% RT reduction
│
├─ Decrease to 0.10 if:
│  - Unrelated concepts appearing together
│  - Recall precision < 0.7
│  - Test: Check `engram_priming_similarity_p50` < 0.65
│
└─ Increase to 0.20 if:
   - Related concepts not benefiting from recent recalls
   - Priming hit rate < 0.10
   - Test: Compare recall latency with/without priming
```

#### D. Performance Profiles (Measured, Not Estimated)

```markdown
### Performance Characteristics

**Semantic Priming:**
- `activate_priming()`: 85μs (P50), 120μs (P95) on 1M node graph
- `compute_priming_boost()`: 8ns (P50), 15ns (P95) - single atomic read
- Memory: 48 bytes per active prime
- Scaling: O(k log n) where k=max_neighbors, n=graph_size

Measured on: M1 Max, 32GB RAM, 1M nodes, 10M edges
Benchmark: `cargo bench --bench priming_performance`
```

#### E. Common Mistakes

```markdown
### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Mistake 1: Forgetting to prune expired primes**
```rust
// BAD: active_primes grows unbounded
loop {
    priming.activate_priming(&episode, &graph);
}

// GOOD: prune every 1000 operations
for (i, episode) in episodes.iter().enumerate() {
    priming.activate_priming(episode, &graph);
    if i % 1000 == 0 {
        priming.prune_expired();
    }
}
```

**Why this matters:** Memory leak, performance degradation over time.
**How to detect:** Monitor `engram_active_primes_total` metric.
```

#### F. API Documentation Template

For each cognitive pattern (Priming, Interference, Reconsolidation):

```markdown
## [Pattern Name]

### What It Does (1 sentence)
[Plain English description]

### When to Use It (decision criteria)
✓ Use when: [scenarios where this pattern helps]
✗ Don't use when: [scenarios where this adds overhead without benefit]

### Quick Start
[5-10 line code example that compiles and runs]

### Configuration
[Table of parameters with defaults and tuning guidance]

### Performance
[Measured latency, memory, throughput]

### Integration
[How this pattern interacts with other cognitive systems]

### Monitoring
[Key metrics to watch, alert thresholds]

### Troubleshooting
[Common issues with symptom-based navigation]
```

---

## 2. Explanation Documentation (docs/explanation/)

**File:** `/docs/explanation/psychology_foundations.md`

### Required Content Structure

#### A. For Each Cognitive Pattern

**1. The Everyday Experience (1 paragraph)**
Describe phenomenon in terms anyone recognizes. No jargon, no citations yet.

*Example:*
> Ever notice how thinking about "doctor" makes "nurse" pop into your head,
> even though no one mentioned nurses? That's semantic priming - your brain
> pre-activates related concepts, making them faster to recall.

**2. The Psychology (2-3 paragraphs with citations)**
Explain the research, key findings, statistical effects.

*Example:*
> Collins & Loftus (1975) proposed spreading activation theory to explain this
> phenomenon. Neely (1977) measured it precisely: people recognize "nurse"
> about 50ms faster after seeing "doctor" compared to an unrelated prime like
> "car". The effect peaks at 500ms stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) and decays
> exponentially over 2-3 seconds.

**3. The Analogy (1-2 paragraphs)**
Bridge cognitive science to implementation using concrete, visual metaphors.

*Example:*
> Think of semantic memory like a neighborhood where related concepts live
> next door. When you "turn on lights" at doctor's house (recall), the glow
> spills over to nearby houses like "nurse" and "hospital." Distant houses
> like "car" stay dark. The glow fades over time (our decay_half_life=500ms).

**4. The Implementation (code with line-by-line psychology mapping)**

```rust
// Finding semantic neighbors = "finding houses in same neighborhood"
let neighbors = graph.find_k_nearest_neighbors(
    &recalled.embedding,
    max_neighbors,  // How many houses get glow
    similarity_threshold  // How close = "neighbor"
);

// Priming strength proportional to similarity
// Closer houses = more glow
let prime_strength = priming_strength * normalized_similarity;

// Exponential decay = glow fading over time
let decayed = initial_strength * 0.5_f32.powf(half_lives);
```

**5. Parameter Justification Table**

| Parameter | Value | Empirical Basis | Validation |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| `priming_strength` | 0.15 | Neely 1977: 10-20% RT reduction | DRM paradigm: 60% false recall |
| `decay_half_life` | 500ms | Neely 1977: SOA effects at 400-600ms | Measured decay matches published curves |
| `similarity_threshold` | 0.6 | Parameter sweep optimization | Minimizes false positives while maximizing hits |

**6. What This Means for Your Application (practical implications)**

```markdown
If you're building a recommendation system:
- Priming = "Users who viewed X often view Y"
- Decay = "Recency matters: recent views prime more strongly"
- Threshold = "Only recommend highly similar items"
- Pruning = "Clear old browsing history periodically"

Configuration guidance:
- E-commerce: Lower threshold (0.5) for discovery
- Medical: Higher threshold (0.7) for precision
- Social: Faster decay (300ms) for trending content
```

#### B. Validation Results Interpretation

For each psychology validation test:

```markdown
### DRM Paradigm: False Memory Generation

**What We Measured:**
People study related words ("bed, rest, awake, tired...") and falsely
"remember" the critical lure ("sleep") 60% of the time, even though it
was never shown (Roediger & McDermott 1995).

**Why This Matters for Engram:**
Validates that our semantic network density and pattern completion
generate plausible false memories, just like human memory. If Engram
couldn't do this, it wouldn't faithfully model cognitive reconstruction.

**Our Results:**
- Target: 55-65% false recall
- Achieved: 62% false recall (n=100 trials, p<0.05)
- Statistical power: 0.85 (exceeds 0.80 requirement)

**Interpretation:**
Engram's semantic associations have human-like strength. Pattern completion
activates critical lures at rates matching psychology literature.

**What to Watch:**
- Too high (>75%): Pattern completion too aggressive → hallucination risk
  Fix: Increase `pattern_completion_threshold` from 0.6 to 0.7

- Too low (<45%): Semantic connections too weak → won't generalize
  Fix: Increase `consolidation_strength` or reduce `similarity_threshold`

**How to Reproduce:**
```bash
cargo test --test drm_paradigm --release -- --nocapture
# Shows trial-by-trial results and statistical summary
```
```

#### C. Biological Plausibility Section

```markdown
## Deviations from Biological Reality

Engram makes deliberate simplifications for engineering tractability:

1. **Simplified Decay Function**
   - Biology: Complex multi-timescale processes (synaptic, cellular, systems)
   - Engram: Single exponential decay with configurable half-life
   - Justification: Captures behavioral effects while remaining tractable
   - Impact: May not model very long-term memory (years) accurately

2. **Discrete Reconsolidation Window**
   - Biology: Gradual transition from labile to stable state
   - Engram: Hard boundaries at 1h and 6h post-recall
   - Justification: Engineering clarity, matches experimental protocols
   - Impact: Edge cases near boundaries may not match human data

3. **Uniform Embedding Space**
   - Biology: Different semantic categories have different neural substrates
   - Engram: Single 768-dimensional embedding space
   - Justification: Practical for vector similarity operations
   - Impact: May not capture domain-specific memory effects
```

## 3. Operations Guide (docs/operations/)

**File:** `/docs/operations/cognitive_metrics_tuning.md`

### Required Runbook Format

For each common operational scenario:

```markdown
## RUNBOOK: [Problem Name]

**Alert Trigger:** [What metric/symptom triggers investigation]
**Business Impact:** [What breaks for users if this isn't fixed]

### Symptoms
- [Observable behavior 1]
- [Observable behavior 2]
- [Metrics pattern]

### Diagnosis Steps

**Step 1: Verify it's a real issue**
```bash
# Command to check if alert is real vs false positive
curl localhost:9090/metrics | grep [relevant_metric]

# Expected: [what healthy looks like]
# Problem: [what unhealthy looks like]
```

**Step 2: Identify root cause**
```bash
# Commands to narrow down cause
engram-cli diagnostic --check [subsystem]

# Look for:
# - [Pattern A] → indicates [root cause X]
# - [Pattern B] → indicates [root cause Y]
```

**Step 3: Assess severity**
- Critical: [when to page on-call]
- High: [when to fix within 1 hour]
- Medium: [when to fix within 1 day]
- Low: [when to add to backlog]

### Fix Options

**Option 1: [Quick Fix Name] (Recommended for most cases)**
```rust
// Configuration change
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .parameter_name(new_value)  // was old_value
    .build()
```

**Pros:** [Benefits]
**Cons:** [Tradeoffs]
**Time to apply:** [How long]
**Validation:** [How to verify fix worked]

**Option 2: [Alternative Fix Name] (Use if Option 1 doesn't work)**
[Similar structure]

**Option 3: [Workaround] (Temporary until proper fix)**
[Similar structure]

### Validation Procedure

After applying fix:

1. **Immediate verification (5 min)**
   ```bash
   # Check metrics return to healthy range
   watch -n 1 'curl -s localhost:9090/metrics | grep [metric]'
   ```

2. **Short-term validation (1 hour)**
   ```bash
   # Run targeted integration test
   cargo test --test [relevant_test] --release
   ```

3. **Long-term monitoring (24 hours)**
   - Alert should not re-fire
   - Related metrics should stabilize
   - User-facing latency P95 should improve

### Prevention

**Monitoring:**
```yaml
# Alert rule to catch this earlier
- alert: [AlertName]
  expr: [PromQL expression]
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: [Description]
    runbook_url: [Link to this runbook]
```

**Pre-deployment validation:**
```bash
# Test that catches this in CI
cargo test --test [regression_test]
```

**Configuration review:**
- Review [parameter] during onboarding
- Run `engram-cli validate-config` before deploy
- Check [metric] in staging for 1 hour before prod

### Related Incidents
- [Date] - [Brief description] - [What we learned]
```

### Required Runbooks (Minimum)

1. **Priming Event Rate Spiking** (>5000/sec)
2. **DRM False Recall Out of Range** (<45% or >75%)
3. **Interference Detection Failures** (0 detections for 1 hour)
4. **Reconsolidation Window Misses** (hit rate <5%)
5. **Memory Leak in Active Primes** (unbounded growth)

---

## 4. Complete Bibliography (docs/explanation/)

### Enhanced Citation Format

For each of the 15 academic papers:

```markdown
1. **Anderson, J. R.** (1974). Retrieval of propositional information from
   long-term memory. *Cognitive Psychology*, 6(4), 451-474.
   DOI: [10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-1)

   **Key Contribution:** Fan effect - retrieval time increases linearly with
   number of facts associated with a concept (50-150ms per additional fact).

   **Relevance to Engram:** Validates our interference detection when nodes
   have high out-degree. Used to set `time_per_association_ms` parameter.

   **Engram Validation:** Task 005 (Fan Effect Detection) - within ±25ms

   **Access:** Available via most university libraries or Sci-Hub. For a
   readable summary, see: [Wikipedia: Fan effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_effect)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Examples Break During Implementation
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (blocks documentation completion)

**Mitigation:**
1. Write examples alongside implementation (Tasks 002-007)
2. Add examples as doc tests in actual source files
3. Run doc tests in CI on every commit
4. Include example validation in pre-commit hooks

### Risk 2: Psychology Explanations Too Technical
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (reduces accessibility)

**Mitigation:**
1. Use "everyday experience" → "psychology" → "implementation" pattern
2. Require analogies for each cognitive pattern
3. External review by non-psychologist developer
4. User feedback mechanism to catch confusion

### Risk 3: Operations Runbooks Not Tested
**Likelihood:** Low (if validation script used)
**Impact:** High (SRE distrust leads to documentation avoidance)

**Mitigation:**
1. Deliberately break things to validate runbooks
2. Run all commands in CI against test deployment
3. Include runbook validation in acceptance testing
4. Track runbook usage and update based on actual incidents
