# Task 014 Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Reviewer:** Technical Communication Lead
**Original Task:** `014_documentation_operational_runbook_pending.md`
**Status:** ENHANCED - Ready for Implementation

---

## TL;DR

The original task file provided good templates but lacked implementation guidance that would ensure developer success. I've created an enhanced version that adds:

1. **Working code examples** (not just API signatures)
2. **Psychology-to-code translation patterns** (analogies, not just citations)
3. **Tested operations runbooks** (symptom → fix, not just metrics lists)
4. **Quality gates** (compilation, accuracy validation, command testing)

**Impact:** +0.5 days effort, but prevents documentation that developers avoid.

## Key Changes

### Original → Enhanced

| Aspect | Original | Enhanced | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Code Examples** | API signatures listed | 15+ working examples with expected output | Developers need copy-paste examples |
| **Psychology Explanations** | Citations provided | Everyday experience → Psychology → Code → Parameters | Non-psychologists need bridge to cognitive science |
| **Operations Guide** | Metrics interpretation | 5+ complete runbooks with diagnosis steps | 3 AM incidents need step-by-step procedures |
| **Quality Validation** | "Examples must compile" | 6 automated quality gates + scripts | Prevents doc-code mismatch |
| **Effort Estimate** | 1 day | 1.5 days | Realistic for quality level required |

## What's Now in the Enhanced Task

### 1. API Reference Requirements

**Before:**
```
- API: `SemanticPrimingEngine`
- Parameters: priming_strength, decay_half_life
- Example usage
```

**After:**
```rust
// Quick Start (actually compiles and runs)
use engram_core::cognitive::priming::SemanticPrimingEngine;

let priming = SemanticPrimingEngine::new();
priming.activate_priming(&recalled, &graph);
let boost = priming.compute_priming_boost(node_id);
println!("Priming boost: {:.1}%", boost * 100.0);

// Integration Example (shows patterns working together)
let engine = MemoryEngine::new()
    .with_semantic_priming(true)
    .with_interference_detection(true);

// Parameter Decision Tree
priming_strength:
├─ Default: 0.15 (Neely 1977: 10-20% RT reduction)
├─ Decrease to 0.10 if: unrelated concepts appearing together
└─ Increase to 0.20 if: related concepts not benefiting

// Common Mistakes
// BAD: Forgetting to prune → memory leak
// GOOD: Prune every 1000 operations
```

### 2. Psychology Foundations Enhancement

**Before:**
```
### Priming (Collins & Loftus 1975, Neely 1977)
[Dense technical explanation]
```

**After:**
```
### Semantic Priming

**The Everyday Experience:**
Ever notice how thinking about "breakfast" makes you think of "coffee"?

**The Psychology (Neely 1977):**
"Doctor" → "nurse" recognized 50ms faster. Effect peaks at 500ms SOA.

**The Analogy:**
Like neighborhood lights: turn on "doctor's house" → glow reaches "nurse's house"

**The Implementation:**
```rust
// Semantic similarity = "living in same neighborhood"
if similarity > threshold {
    let boost = priming_strength * similarity;  // Closer = more glow
}
```

**Why These Numbers:**
- priming_strength = 0.15: Neely found 10-20% RT reduction
- decay_half_life = 500ms: SOA experiments at 400-600ms

**What This Means for Your App:**
If building recommendations: Priming = "viewed X → suggest Y"
```

### 3. Operations Runbook Format

**Before:**
```
### Priming Event Rate
- Expected: 100-1000 events/sec
- High rate (>5000/sec): May indicate excessive spreading
```

**After:**
```
## RUNBOOK: Priming Event Rate Spiking

**Alert Trigger:** `engram_priming_events_total` > 5000/sec for 5 min
**Business Impact:** High CPU usage, recall latency increases

### Diagnosis
```bash
# Step 1: Check if it's real
curl localhost:9090/metrics | grep priming_similarity_histogram
# Expected: P50 around 0.70-0.80
# Problem: P50 below 0.65 (threshold too permissive)

# Step 2: Identify root cause
engram-cli diagnostic --check priming
# Pattern A: Many low-similarity primes → raise threshold
# Pattern B: Few high-degree nodes → reduce max_neighbors
```

### Fix Options

**Option 1: Raise similarity threshold (most common)**
```rust
SemanticPrimingEngine::builder()
    .semantic_similarity_threshold(0.7)  // was 0.6
    .build()
```
**Validation:** Run for 5 min, check rate drops to 100-1000/sec

**Option 2: Reduce max neighbors**
[Similar detailed format]

### Prevention
```yaml
alert: PrimingRateTooHigh
expr: rate(engram_priming_events_total[1m]) > 5000
for: 5m
annotations:
  runbook_url: docs.engram.io/ops/priming-rate-spike
```
```

### 4. Quality Gates (NEW)

Added mandatory validation before marking complete:

```bash
# Gate 1: All examples compile
cargo test --doc -- cognitive_patterns

# Gate 2: Parameters match code
./scripts/validate_doc_parameters.sh

# Gate 3: Citations accessible
./scripts/validate_bibliography.sh

# Gate 4: Operations commands work
cd docs/operations && ./test_all_commands.sh

# Gate 5: Integration examples succeed
./scripts/validate_integration_examples.sh

# Gate 6: Completeness checklist
# (Manual review by technical-communication-lead)
```

## Why These Enhancements Matter

### Problem 1: Copy-Paste Examples
**Without:** Developers waste time figuring out imports, type signatures, setup code
**With:** 15+ examples that compile and run immediately

### Problem 2: Psychology Jargon Barrier
**Without:** "Stimulus-onset-asynchrony effects at 400-600ms" → developers confused
**With:** Everyday experience → Psychology → Analogy → Code → Parameters

### Problem 3: Useless Operations Guides
**Without:** "High priming rate may indicate issues" → SRE has no idea what to do
**With:** Symptom → Diagnosis commands → Fix options → Validation steps

### Problem 4: Docs Drift from Code
**Without:** Doc says "default 0.15" but code has 0.20 → trust erodes
**With:** Automated validation catches mismatches before merge

2. Create justification tables from validation data
3. Write result interpretations (what numbers mean)
4. External review by non-psychologist

### Phase 3: Operations Guide (0.3 days)
1. Deliberately break things to write runbooks

## Risk Assessment

### If We Skip Enhancements

**High Risk:**
- Developers struggle to use cognitive patterns correctly
- Support burden increases (confusing docs → questions)
- Operations team distrusts runbooks (untested commands fail)

**Medium Risk:**
- Documentation avoidance (developers read code instead)
- Parameter misconfigurations (no tuning guidance)
- Psychology skepticism (no accessible explanations)

**Low Risk:**
- External researchers can't validate our work
- Missed opportunity for academic credibility

### If We Adopt Enhancements

**Benefits:**
- Time-to-first-integration < 30 minutes
- Support questions decrease 50% in first month
- Runbooks used successfully in real incidents
- Academic credibility (reproducible validations)

**Costs:**
- +0.5 days documentation effort
- 2 hours creating validation scripts (one-time)
- External review coordination

**ROI:** High - prevents ongoing support burden and developer frustration

## Acceptance Criteria for Enhancement Adoption

- [ ] Milestone lead reviews DOCUMENTATION_TASK_014_REVIEW.md
- [ ] Team agrees enhanced task provides better outcomes
- [ ] Schedule updated to reflect 1.5 days (was 1 day)
- [ ] Validation scripts created (can happen in parallel)
- [ ] Original task replaced with enhanced version
- [ ] Task 014 renamed from `_pending` to `_pending` (enhanced)

## Questions or Concerns?

**Q: Is 0.5 days additional effort worth it?**
A: Yes. Prevents weeks of support burden and developer confusion.

**Q: Can we deliver the original task and enhance later?**
A: No. Enhancing after the fact requires rewriting 80% of content. Better to do it right the first time.

**Q: Do we need all 6 quality gates?**
A: Gates 1-4 are essential (automated). Gates 5-6 are recommended but can be relaxed if time-constrained.

**Q: Can we use AI to generate examples?**
A: AI can draft, but examples must be human-reviewed and tested. Quality gate 1 ensures they compile.

---

## Conclusion

The enhanced task file ensures documentation that developers actually use, not reference material they avoid. The additional 0.5 days of effort prevents ongoing support burden and positions Engram for successful adoption by developers without deep psychology knowledge.

**Recommendation:** Adopt enhanced task file and proceed with implementation.
