# Psychology Validation Test Design Review
**Reviewer:** Professor John Regehr (Verification Testing Lead)
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Focus:** Empirical validation against published psychology literature

---

## Executive Summary

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: CONDITIONAL PASS** - Test designs are fundamentally sound but require critical fixes before implementation. Task 008 (DRM) has the strongest design with proper statistical methodology. Tasks 009 and 010 have significant methodological gaps that will compromise validation reliability.

### Critical Findings
- **Task 008 (DRM):** PASS with minor improvements needed
- **Task 009 (Spacing Effect):** FAIL - insufficient statistical power, time simulation risks
- **Task 010 (Interference Suite):** FAIL - skeletal specification, missing critical experimental details

### Required Actions Before Implementation
1. **Task 009:** Increase sample size from n=50 to n≥100, add artifact detection
2. **Task 010:** Complete experimental protocol specifications for all three paradigms
3. **All tasks:** Add parameter sweep recovery strategy for validation failures

---

## Task 008: DRM False Memory Paradigm - DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Test Design Quality: **PASS (85/100)**

#### Strengths
1. **Precise Replication:** Correctly implements Roediger & McDermott (1995) protocol
   - 15-word lists with high backward associative strength (BAS)
   - Critical lure never presented during study
   - Clear distinction between false recall and false recognition

2. **Statistical Rigor:** Proper power analysis
   - n=100 trials (4 lists × 25 trials) ✓
   - 95% confidence intervals computed correctly
   - Standard error: SE = √(p(1-p)/n) ✓
   - Effect sizes not calculated (MISSING - see below)

3. **Acceptance Criteria:** Well-defined with appropriate tolerance
   - Target: 60% ± 10% → [50%, 70%] acceptance range ✓
   - Mechanistic validation: `is_reconstructed: true` flag ✓
   - Confidence paradox test included ✓

4. **Experimental Control:**
   - Fresh engine per trial (prevents contamination) ✓
   - Per-list validation (detects outlier lists) ✓
   - Veridical recall measured (ensures basic memory works) ✓

#### Critical Weaknesses

**1. MISSING: Effect Size Calculation (Cohen's d)**

The acceptance criteria mention "Effect size (Cohen's d) > 0.8" but the `DrmAnalysis` struct doesn't compute it. This is essential for comparison with published research.

**Required Addition:**
```rust
impl DrmAnalysis {
    fn compute_cohens_d(&self, true_recall_rate: f64) -> f64 {
        // Cohen's d = (M1 - M2) / pooled_SD
        // For binary outcomes (recall yes/no), use proportion formula
        let p1 = self.false_recall_rate;
        let p2 = true_recall_rate;
        let n = self.total_trials as f64;

        let pooled_sd = ((p1 * (1.0 - p1) + p2 * (1.0 - p2)) / 2.0).sqrt();
        (p1 - p2).abs() / pooled_sd
    }
}
```

**2. MISSING: Embedding Function (`get_embedding`)**

Line 176 calls `get_embedding(word)` but this function is never defined. The test will not compile without it.

**Required Implementation:**
- Either mock embeddings (e.g., random vectors with controlled similarity)
- Or use real embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002 / sentence-transformers)
- **Critical:** Semantic similarity between list items and critical lure must be high (BAS > 0.3)
- **Recommendation:** Use pre-computed embeddings from actual word lists to ensure realistic semantic structure

**3. WEAK: Time Simulation (`std::thread::sleep(100ms)`)**

The 100ms sleep is arbitrary and may not trigger consolidation properly. This is a common timing assumption bug.

**Required Fix:**
```rust
// Replace arbitrary sleep with explicit consolidation trigger
// Don't rely on wall-clock time for cognitive operations
engine.trigger_consolidation(); // Synchronous consolidation
// OR verify that sleep duration is sufficient:
const CONSOLIDATION_DELAY: Duration = Duration::from_millis(100);
std::thread::sleep(CONSOLIDATION_DELAY);
engine.await_consolidation_complete(); // Verify completion
```

**4. FRAGILE: String Matching for False Recall Detection**

Line 196: `r.content.to_lowercase().contains(&list.critical_lure.to_lowercase())`

This will produce false positives. Example: critical lure "chair" will match "chairman" or "wheelchair".

**Required Fix:**
```rust
// Use exact word matching or semantic similarity threshold
let false_recall = lure_results.iter().any(|r| {
    r.is_reconstructed() &&
    semantic_similarity(&r.embedding, &lure_embedding) > 0.85
});
```

#### Statistical Power Analysis

**Sample Size Calculation:**
- Target effect: 60% false recall vs 70% veridical recall
- Effect size: ~0.2-0.3 (small to medium)
- Power: Want β = 0.80 (80% power)
- Alpha: α = 0.05 (standard)

**Required n for detecting 10% difference:**
```
n = (Z_α + Z_β)² × (p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)) / (p₁ - p₂)²
n = (1.96 + 0.84)² × (0.6×0.4 + 0.7×0.3) / (0.1)²
n = 7.84 × 0.45 / 0.01 = 353 trials
```

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Current design uses n=100, which gives power ≈ 0.50 (coin flip). This is insufficient.

**Required Fix:**
- Increase to n ≥ 200 for 80% power
- OR accept lower power but document this limitation
- OR widen acceptance range to ±15% (making test less sensitive)

**Recommendation:** Increase trials to 50 per list (4 lists × 50 = 200 total).

#### Risk Mitigation for Validation Failures

**Current Plan:** "Re-tune semantic priming parameters" (line 493)

**Missing:** No systematic parameter sweep strategy. If validation fails, developers will waste time guessing.

**Required Addition:**
```rust
#[test]
#[ignore] // Run only when main validation fails
fn test_drm_parameter_sweep() {
    // Systematic exploration of parameter space
    let priming_strengths = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5];
    let completion_thresholds = [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7];
    let consolidation_depths = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10];

    let mut best_params = None;
    let mut best_error = f64::MAX;

    for &priming in &priming_strengths {
        for &threshold in &completion_thresholds {
            for &depth in &consolidation_depths {
                let config = DrmConfig { priming, threshold, depth };
                let analysis = run_drm_with_config(&config);
                let error = (analysis.false_recall_rate - 0.60).abs();

                if error < best_error {
                    best_error = error;
                    best_params = Some(config);
                }

                println!("Config {:?} → error {:.3}", config, error);
            }
        }
    }

    println!("\nBest parameters: {:?} (error: {:.3})", best_params, best_error);
}
```

### Recommendations for Task 008

**MUST FIX (P0):**
1. Implement `get_embedding()` function with realistic semantic similarity
2. Replace string matching with semantic similarity threshold
3. Increase sample size to n=200 or document power limitation
4. Add effect size (Cohen's d) calculation

**SHOULD FIX (P1):**
5. Replace arbitrary sleep with explicit consolidation trigger
6. Add parameter sweep test for failure recovery
7. Add chi-square test (mentioned in line 39 but not implemented)

**NICE TO HAVE (P2):**
8. Test false recognition (currently stubbed out)
9. Add modulating factor tests (list length, semantic strength, retention interval)
10. Compare confidence distributions between true and false memories (not just means)

## Task 009: Spacing Effect Validation - DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Test Design Quality: **FAIL (45/100)**

#### Strengths
1. **Clear Hypothesis:** Distributed > Massed practice (Cepeda et al. 2006)
2. **Appropriate Design:** Between-subjects with matched items
3. **Reasonable Acceptance Range:** 20-40% ± 10% → [10%, 50%]

#### Critical Weaknesses

**1. CATASTROPHIC: Insufficient Statistical Power**

Current design: n=50 (25 massed, 25 distributed)

**Power Analysis:**
- Expected effect: 30% improvement (Cohen's d ≈ 0.5, medium effect)
- With n=25 per group: power ≈ 0.35 (terrible)
- Required for 80% power: n ≥ 64 per group (128 total)

**RESULT:** Test will fail to detect real spacing effect 65% of the time.

**Required Fix:**
```rust
// Increase sample size significantly
const ITEMS_PER_CONDITION: usize = 100; // Was 25
let study_items = generate_random_facts(ITEMS_PER_CONDITION * 2);
```

**2. CRITICAL: Time Simulation Artifact Detection Missing**

Line 60-67: `engine.advance_time(Duration::hours(1))` - This is simulation, not real time.

**Risk:** Time simulation may introduce artifacts (e.g., batch processing effects, discrete time steps). The test has no way to detect if `advance_time()` is working correctly.

**Required Addition:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_time_simulation_validity() {
    // Validate that advance_time() doesn't introduce artifacts
    let engine = MemoryEngine::new();

    // Store two identical items
    let item1 = Episode::new("test", embedding.clone());
    let item2 = Episode::new("test", embedding.clone());

    engine.store_episode(item1);
    let conf1 = engine.recall_by_cue("test").confidence;

    engine.advance_time(Duration::hours(24));

    engine.store_episode(item2);
    let conf2 = engine.recall_by_cue("test").confidence;

    // Both should decay identically (time simulation consistency)
    assert!(
        (conf1 - conf2).abs() < 0.01,
        "Time simulation introduces decay artifacts: {:.3} vs {:.3}",
        conf1, conf2
    );
}
```

**3. CRITICAL: Undefined Functions**

- Line 48: `generate_random_facts(50)` - Not defined
- Line 72: `test_retention(&engine, massed_group)` - Defined but uses undefined methods:
  - Line 95: `recall_result.is_successful()` - Episode doesn't have this method
  - Line 95: `recall_result.matches(item)` - Episode doesn't have this method

**Required Fix:** Define all helper functions or clarify API contracts.

**4. WEAK: No Statistical Test Implementation**

Line 123 mentions "paired t-test, p < 0.05" but no implementation exists.

**Required Addition:**
```rust
use statrs::distribution::StudentsT;
use statrs::statistics::Statistics;

fn compute_paired_t_test(group1: &[f32], group2: &[f32]) -> (f64, f64) {
    let n = group1.len() as f64;
    let differences: Vec<f64> = group1.iter()
        .zip(group2.iter())
        .map(|(a, b)| (*a - *b) as f64)
        .collect();

    let mean_diff = differences.mean();
    let sd_diff = differences.std_dev();
    let se = sd_diff / n.sqrt();
    let t = mean_diff / se;
    let df = n - 1.0;

    let dist = StudentsT::new(0.0, 1.0, df).unwrap();
    let p_value = 2.0 * (1.0 - dist.cdf(t.abs()));

    (t, p_value)
}
```

**5. WEAK: Stability Testing Underspecified**

Line 137: "Test passes consistently (8/10 runs minimum)" - This is too lenient for a validation test.

**Problem:** With this criterion, you could have a broken implementation that works by chance 80% of the time.

**Better Approach:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_spacing_effect_stability() {
    const REPLICATIONS: usize = 30;
    let mut successes = 0;

    for _ in 0..REPLICATIONS {
        let result = run_spacing_effect_trial();
        if result.passes_acceptance_criteria() {
            successes += 1;
        }
    }

    // Binomial test: if true pass rate is 95%, getting <25/30 successes is p < 0.05
    assert!(
        successes >= 25,
        "Test instability: {}/{} replications passed (expected ≥25/30 at 95% reliability)",
        successes, REPLICATIONS
    );
}
```

#### Statistical Power Analysis

**Current Design:**
- n = 25 per group
- Expected improvement: 30% (0.30)
- Power = 0.35 (inadequate)

**Required Sample Size:**
```
For Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect):
n = 2 × (Z_α + Z_β)² / d²
n = 2 × (1.96 + 0.84)² / 0.5²
n = 2 × 7.84 / 0.25 = 63 per group
```

**Recommendation:** Use n ≥ 100 per group (200 total) for robust detection.

### Recommendations for Task 009

**MUST FIX (P0):**
1. Increase sample size to n ≥ 100 per condition (200 total)
2. Implement time simulation artifact detection test
3. Define all helper functions (`generate_random_facts`, retention test methods)
4. Implement paired t-test statistical validation

**SHOULD FIX (P1):**
5. Strengthen stability criterion (≥25/30 replications, not 8/10)
6. Add parameter sweep for failure recovery
7. Test multiple spacing intervals (not just 1 hour)

**NICE TO HAVE (P2):**
8. Compare against Cepeda et al. (2006) meta-analysis curve (optimal spacing by retention interval)
9. Test interaction with retention interval
10. Validate against retrieval practice effect (distributed practice benefits from repeated retrieval)

---

## Task 010: Interference Validation Suite - DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Test Design Quality: **FAIL (30/100)**

#### Strengths
1. **Correct Phenomena Identified:** PI, RI, fan effect all relevant
2. **Appropriate References:** Underwood (1957), McGeoch (1942), Anderson (1974)
3. **Reasonable Acceptance Ranges:** ±10% for PI/RI, ±25ms for fan effect

#### Critical Weaknesses

**1. CATASTROPHIC: Skeletal Specification**

The entire implementation section (lines 44-66) is just stubs:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_underwood_1957_validation() {
    // Exactly replicates Underwood (1957) experimental design
    // Expected: 20-30% ±10% accuracy reduction
}
```

**This is not a specification. It's a TODO list.**

**What's Missing:**
- Experimental protocol details
- Stimulus materials
- Procedure steps
- Dependent variable measurement
- Statistical analysis plan

**2. CRITICAL: No Sample Size Specifications**

No mention of how many trials, participants, or replications are needed for each test.

**Required for Each Test:**
```rust
// Proactive Interference (Underwood 1957)
const N_PARTICIPANTS: usize = 50;  // Simulated memory engines
const N_WORD_LISTS: usize = 10;    // 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 prior lists
const WORDS_PER_LIST: usize = 10;
const RETENTION_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::hours(24);
```

**3. CRITICAL: Missing Experimental Protocols**

I'll provide what each test MUST include:

#### Proactive Interference (Underwood 1957)

**Procedure:**
1. Learn lists L1, L2, ..., Ln (n = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20)
2. Learn target list T
3. Test recall of T after 24 hours
4. Measure: Recall accuracy as function of n

**Expected Pattern:**
- 0 prior lists: 65-75% recall
- 1 prior list: 60-70% recall
- 5 prior lists: 45-55% recall (20-30% reduction)
- 20 prior lists: 35-45% recall (40-50% reduction)

**Statistical Test:**
- Linear regression: Recall ~ N_prior_lists
- Slope should be negative and significant (p < 0.01)
- R² > 0.70 (strong relationship)

#### Retroactive Interference (McGeoch 1942)

**Procedure:**
1. **Control group:** Learn list A, rest, test A
2. **Experimental group:** Learn list A, learn list B, test A
3. Lists A and B should have semantic overlap (critical)

**Expected:**
- Control: 70-80% recall
- Experimental: 55-65% recall
- Difference: 15-25% reduction

**Statistical Test:**
- Independent t-test: Control vs Experimental
- Effect size: Cohen's d > 0.8 (large effect)

**MISSING DETAIL:** Semantic overlap specification
- If A and B are unrelated: minimal interference
- If A and B share semantic features: strong interference
- Need to specify overlap (e.g., 50% of words from same category)

#### Fan Effect (Anderson 1974)

**Procedure:**
1. Learn facts with varying fan (number of associations):
   - "The doctor is in the park" (1-1 fan: doctor appears 1×, park appears 1×)
   - "The lawyer is in the church" (1-1 fan)
   - "The doctor is in the bank" (2-2 fan: doctor appears 2×, bank appears 2×)
2. Test recognition with reaction time measurement
3. Measure: RT as function of fan

**Expected Pattern (Anderson 1974):**
- Fan 1-1: 1000ms baseline RT
- Fan 1-2: 1050ms (+50ms)
- Fan 2-2: 1100ms (+100ms)
- Fan 2-3: 1150ms (+150ms)

**Critical Issue:** RT measurement requires:
- Precise timing of recall latency
- Does MemoryStore API support this?
- Need `recall_with_latency() -> (Results, Duration)` method

**Statistical Test:**
- Linear regression: RT ~ Fan
- Slope: 50-150ms per association (±25ms tolerance)
- R² > 0.80 (very strong relationship)

**4. MISSING: Acceptance Criteria Details**

Line 80-85 lists criteria but provides no implementation details:
- "Statistical significance (p < 0.05)" - Which test?
- "Effect size (Cohen's d)" - How calculated for each paradigm?
- "Correlation with published data >0.80" - Correlation of what?

**5. MISSING: Failure Recovery Strategy**

No parameter sweep or diagnostic tests specified for validation failures.

### Statistical Power Analysis (All Tests)

**Required Sample Sizes:**

**Proactive Interference:**
- Regression analysis with 6 levels (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 lists)
- Need n ≥ 15 per level for power > 0.80
- Total: 90 trials minimum

**Retroactive Interference:**
- Between-groups t-test
- Medium-large effect (d ≈ 0.8)
- Need n ≥ 26 per group
- Total: 52 trials minimum

**Fan Effect:**
- Regression with 4 fan levels (1-1, 1-2, 2-2, 2-3)
- Large effect (R² ≈ 0.80)
- Need n ≥ 20 per level
- Total: 80 trials minimum

**Overall: Need ~250 total trials across all three tests**

### Recommendations for Task 010

**MUST FIX (P0 - BLOCKING):**
1. Write complete experimental protocols for all three tests
2. Specify sample sizes (n ≥ 90 for PI, n ≥ 52 for RI, n ≥ 80 for fan)
3. Define stimulus materials (word lists, facts, semantic overlap specifications)
4. Specify statistical analysis for each test (regression, t-test, effect sizes)
5. Clarify API requirements (Does MemoryStore support RT measurement?)

**SHOULD FIX (P1):**
6. Add parameter sweep strategy for validation failures
7. Specify artifact detection tests (ensure interference is cognitive, not storage artifacts)
8. Add validation that control conditions work (e.g., no interference with unrelated lists)

**NICE TO HAVE (P2):**
9. Test interactions between interference types
10. Validate interference reduction with retrieval practice
11. Compare against full empirical curves (not just acceptance ranges)

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 1. API Availability Risk

**Critical Issue:** All three tasks assume APIs that may not exist:
- `MemoryEngine` (Tasks 008, 009)
- `engine.consolidate()` (Task 008)
- `engine.advance_time()` (Task 009)
- `recall_with_latency()` (Task 010)

**Required Action Before Implementation:**
```bash
# Verify API availability
grep -r "pub struct MemoryEngine" engram-core/src/
grep -r "pub fn consolidate" engram-core/src/
grep -r "pub fn advance_time" engram-core/src/
grep -r "pub fn recall_by_cue" engram-core/src/
```

**Mitigation:** Create API compatibility test before starting implementation:
```rust
#[test]
fn test_psychology_validation_api_availability() {
    // Verify all required APIs exist
    let engine = MemoryEngine::new(); // ✓ exists
    engine.store_episode(episode);     // ✓ exists
    engine.consolidate();              // ? verify
    engine.advance_time(duration);     // ? verify
    let (results, latency) = engine.recall_with_latency(cue); // ? verify
}
```

### 2. Embedding Realism

All three tasks require realistic semantic embeddings:
- Task 008: High BAS between list items and critical lure
- Task 009: Matched semantic content across conditions
- Task 010: Controlled semantic overlap for interference

**Current Status:** Embedding generation not specified.

**Required:** Pre-compute embeddings using real model (sentence-transformers) and validate semantic structure:
```rust
fn validate_drm_semantic_structure(word_lists: &DrmWordLists) {
    for list in &word_lists.lists {
        let lure_embedding = get_embedding(&list.critical_lure);

        for word in &list.study_items {
            let word_embedding = get_embedding(word);
            let similarity = cosine_similarity(&lure_embedding, &word_embedding);

            assert!(
                similarity > 0.3,
                "Word '{}' has insufficient semantic association with lure '{}': {:.3}",
                word, list.critical_lure, similarity
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Time Simulation Validity

Tasks 009 and 010 rely on simulated time progression.

**Risk:** Simulation artifacts (discretization, batch effects, clock drift).

**Required Validation:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_time_simulation_linearity() {
    // Verify advance_time(1h) + advance_time(1h) == advance_time(2h)
    let engine1 = MemoryEngine::new();
    engine1.store_episode(episode.clone());
    engine1.advance_time(Duration::hours(1));
    engine1.advance_time(Duration::hours(1));
    let conf1 = engine1.recall(cue).confidence;

    let engine2 = MemoryEngine::new();
    engine2.store_episode(episode.clone());
    engine2.advance_time(Duration::hours(2));
    let conf2 = engine2.recall(cue).confidence;

    assert!(
        (conf1 - conf2).abs() < 0.01,
        "Time simulation non-linear: {} vs {}",
        conf1, conf2
    );
}
```

### 4. Determinism and Reproducibility

**Missing from all tasks:** Seed control for random number generation.

**Required:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_drm_reproducibility() {
    let seed = 42;

    let result1 = run_drm_trial_with_seed(seed);
    let result2 = run_drm_trial_with_seed(seed);

    assert_eq!(
        result1.false_recall, result2.false_recall,
        "DRM test is non-deterministic despite seed"
    );
}
```

---

## Overall Risk Assessment

### High Risk (P0 - BLOCKING)
1. **Task 010:** Completely underspecified - cannot implement without full protocol
2. **Task 009:** Insufficient statistical power - will fail to detect real effects
3. **All tasks:** API availability unclear - may not be implementable

### Medium Risk (P1 - DEGRADATION)
4. **Task 008:** Missing helper functions - test won't compile
5. **Task 009:** Time simulation artifacts - may produce false positives/negatives
6. **All tasks:** No parameter sweep strategy - will waste time if validation fails

### Low Risk (P2 - QUALITY)
7. **Task 008:** Slightly underpowered (n=100 vs optimal n=200)
8. **All tasks:** Missing determinism tests
9. **All tasks:** No embedding validation

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (Before Task 008)**
1. Verify API availability (MemoryEngine, consolidate, advance_time, etc.)
2. Implement embedding generation with semantic validation
3. Create time simulation validation tests
4. Add determinism/reproducibility framework

**Phase 2: DRM (Task 008) - Highest Priority**
1. Implement helper functions (get_embedding, etc.)
2. Increase sample size to n=200
3. Add effect size calculation
4. Add parameter sweep for failure recovery
5. Run validation and document results

**Phase 3: Spacing Effect (Task 009) - After DRM Success**
1. Increase sample size to n=200
2. Implement statistical tests (t-test)
3. Add time simulation artifact detection
4. Run validation and document results

**Phase 4: Interference Suite (Task 010) - After Task 009**
1. Write complete experimental protocols
2. Implement all three paradigms (PI, RI, fan)
3. Add sample size specifications
4. Run validation and document results

## Final Recommendations

### Task 008 (DRM): APPROVED with Required Fixes
**Verdict:** Can proceed to implementation after fixing P0 issues.

**Required Before Implementation:**
1. Implement `get_embedding()` with realistic semantic similarity
2. Replace string matching with semantic threshold
3. Add effect size (Cohen's d) calculation
4. Consider increasing to n=200 (or document power limitation)

**Estimated Additional Effort:** +0.5 days

### Task 009 (Spacing Effect): CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
**Verdict:** Requires significant improvements before implementation.

**Required Before Implementation:**
1. Increase sample size to n ≥ 100 per condition
2. Implement statistical tests (paired t-test)
3. Add time simulation artifact detection
4. Define all helper functions

**Estimated Additional Effort:** +1 day (total: 2 days)

### Task 010 (Interference Suite): BLOCKED - Requires Redesign
**Verdict:** Specification incomplete. Cannot implement until protocols defined.

**Required Before Implementation:**
1. Write complete experimental protocols for PI, RI, fan effect
2. Specify stimulus materials and semantic structure
3. Define sample sizes and statistical analysis plans
4. Verify API supports RT measurement (fan effect)
5. Create detailed implementation specification

**Estimated Additional Effort:** +2 days (total: 3 days)

## Conclusion

The psychology validation suite demonstrates strong theoretical grounding but varying levels of methodological rigor. Task 008 (DRM) is nearly ready for implementation with minor fixes. Tasks 009 and 010 require substantial work to meet empirical validation standards.

**Key Insight:** These are not unit tests - they are empirical validation studies. They require the same rigor as publishing a psychology paper. Shortcuts in statistical methodology will produce unreliable validation results that undermine confidence in Engram's cognitive plausibility.

**Bottom Line:** Fix Task 008 issues, redesign Task 009 for adequate power, and complete Task 010 specification before implementation. Budget +3.5 days total additional effort.
