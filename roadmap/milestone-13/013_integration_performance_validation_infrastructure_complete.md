# Task 013: Integration Testing and Performance Validation

**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** P0 (Quality Gate)
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days
**Dependencies:** All implementation tasks (001-007, 011)
**Agent Review Required:** verification-testing-lead

## Overview

Comprehensive integration testing to ensure all cognitive patterns work together correctly and performance requirements are met. This is the final quality gate before milestone completion.

## Test Coverage

### Integration Tests

1. **All Cognitive Patterns Together**
   - Priming + Interference + Reconsolidation operating concurrently
   - No conflicts or race conditions
   - Metrics track all events correctly

2. **End-to-End Scenarios**
   - Store episode → Prime related concepts → Detect interference → Reconsolidate
   - DRM paradigm with all cognitive systems active
   - Spacing effect with priming and interference

3. **Concurrency and Thread Safety**
   - Multiple threads performing cognitive operations
   - Lock-free data structures verified via loom
   - No deadlocks or data races

### Performance Validation

1. **Metrics Overhead**
   - **Target:** <1% overhead when monitoring enabled
   - **Target:** 0% overhead when monitoring disabled (assembly verified)
   - **Measurement:** Criterion benchmarks on production workloads

2. **Latency Requirements**
   - Priming boost computation: <10μs
   - Interference detection: <100μs
   - Reconsolidation check: <50μs
   - Metrics recording: <50ns

3. **Throughput Requirements**
   - 10K recalls/sec with all cognitive patterns enabled
   - 1K reconsolidation attempts/sec
   - No memory leaks during 10-minute soak test

### Psychology Validations

Must pass all validation tests:
- [ ] DRM false recall: 55-65% ±10% (Task 008)
- [ ] Spacing effect: 20-40% ±10% (Task 009)
- [ ] Proactive interference: 20-30% ±10% (Task 010)
- [ ] Retroactive interference: 15-25% ±10% (Task 010)
- [ ] Fan effect: 50-150ms ±25ms (Task 010)

### File Structure

```

### Integration Test Suite

**File:** `/engram-core/tests/integration/cognitive_patterns_integration.rs`

```rust
#[test]
fn test_all_cognitive_patterns_integrate_correctly() {
    let engine = MemoryEngine::with_all_cognitive_patterns();

    // Store episodes with priming
    // Detect interference
    // Modify via reconsolidation
    // Verify all systems worked correctly
}

#[test]
fn test_no_conflicts_between_cognitive_systems() {
    // Run all cognitive systems concurrently
    // Verify no race conditions or conflicts
}

#[test]
fn test_metrics_track_all_events_correctly() {
    #[cfg(feature = "monitoring")]
    {
        // Enable all cognitive patterns
        // Perform operations
        // Verify metrics match expected counts
    }
}
```

### Performance Benchmark Suite

**File:** `/engram-core/benches/cognitive_patterns_performance.rs`

```rust
fn benchmark_metrics_overhead(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("metrics_overhead");

    group.bench_function("recall_no_monitoring", |b| {
        b.iter(|| perform_recall_without_monitoring());
    });

    #[cfg(feature = "monitoring")]
    group.bench_function("recall_with_monitoring", |b| {
        b.iter(|| perform_recall_with_monitoring());
    });

    group.finish();
}

fn benchmark_cognitive_operations(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("priming_boost_computation", |b| {
        b.iter(|| compute_priming_boost(node_id));
    });

    c.bench_function("interference_detection", |b| {
        b.iter(|| detect_interference(&episode, &priors));
    });

    c.bench_function("reconsolidation_check", |b| {
        b.iter(|| check_reconsolidation_eligibility(&episode));
    });
}
```

### Soak Test

```rust
#[test]
#[ignore]  // Long-running test
fn test_no_memory_leaks_during_soak() {
    let engine = MemoryEngine::with_all_cognitive_patterns();
    let start_memory = get_memory_usage();

    // Run for 10 minutes
    for _ in 0..600_000 {
        perform_cognitive_operations(&engine);
    }

    let end_memory = get_memory_usage();
    let growth = end_memory - start_memory;

    assert!(growth < 100_MB, "Memory leak detected: {} growth", growth);
}
```

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk:** Integration conflicts between cognitive systems
- **Mitigation:** Incremental integration, test after each addition
- **Mitigation:** Clear module boundaries and interfaces

**Risk:** Performance regressions
- **Mitigation:** Benchmark early and often
- **Mitigation:** Profiling to identify hot spots

**Risk:** Psychology validations fail in integration
- **Mitigation:** Run validation tests continuously during development
- **Mitigation:** Budget extra time for tuning
